It lasts a full 12 hours and I have experienced no side-effects whatsoever. The albuterol solution I used to use in my nebulizer would make me shake and made my heart race. The Perforomist doesn't have this effect at all. As a matter of fact, I don't feel any different after a treatment than I did before the treatment, except that I can breathe normally. Since I've been using Perforomist, (once in the morning)I rarely need my fast acting inhaler during the day. My energy level is up and I can do more physical things (like exercise) without my breathing going bad. It's so nice to feel normal after such a long time. Much thanks to the makers of Perforomist.

The lack of the capsule rattling as it should in the Handihaler, I have found, is typically due to either (1) broken capsule pieces remaining in the device after use or (2), as others have pointed out, the entire top breaking off the capsule in the device.
 
I did discover something that appears to make a difference. Of course, I check for stray bits of capsule with every use but I have found that making sure the capsule goes into the Handihaler with the large end DOWN improves the performance of the device.

I have been watching this for about 3 weeks and have had no problems with the capsule in the apparently right, large end down,  position. In that period I have two ""no rattle"" applications; on both I checked to find the large end was up.

I am very careful to open the hanidhaler completely before and after every use to check of stray capsule bits that might interfere with the ""rattle"" process.  The problem is that the capsule is intended to be punctured with small holes near the top and bottom. I have noticed that at the time the rattle is not present the upper puncture device has completely cracked the top off of the capsule. I know it is not intended to work this way.

Have suggested they make the capsule fully or partly clear so patients can see the powder in the capsule before they take their med & no powder after they've taken their med.  BI (manufacturer) says they'll consider the suggestion, which has been implemented in some other countries.

A never ending stuffy and running nose.  Sneezing, congestion, sinus ache, pressure in head and face, my ears would feel like they had water in them. Itchy & scratchy throat, change in voice, fever, and I could not smell or taste anything after the first week of taking Advair Diskus.  My doctor told me I just had a cold and not to worry.  After a month of telling her of my ongoing symptoms, she said I was having an allergic reaction to the medication and that I should take ""Claritin"" to counteract the effects of the alergic reaction.  I did so for a week but found no signifigant changes.  My doctor then advised me to stop taking the Advair.  It's been 10 days since I've stopped the use of Advair.  I still cannot taste or smell but the symptoms I mentioned above are slowly diminishing, Thank God!   But now I have a cough that's developed and seems to get worse at night time.  It's a dry, non-productive cough.  I haven't had this type of cough before.  The reason I was put on Advair was because a doctor I went to said I had COPD.  The doctor I went to before this one said I had Bronchitis and gave me antibiotics and an inhaler.  I really felt fine after that.  I thought everything was ok, but followed up for a re-check a month later as the 1st doctor had advised.  I would have never thought in million years that I had COPD.  I didn't have any symptoms of anything of the nature until I got a cold in Feb. 09.  The cold went away but the cough never did.  It was my fault for waiting 3 months to seek help for this cough.  I never get sick.  At this point I don't know what to do.

Sent me for ultra sound because he thought I had gall bladder problem and x-rays of spine and hips for bone pain.  Both didn't show any problems.  I got fed up and stopped using the Advair.  Surprise, a lot less gas and acid reflux, bone pain gone, less muscle cramps.  In the meantime he wants me to continue to use QVAR 80 mg. 2 puffs in the am and my rescue inhaler (Ventolin HFA) 2 puffs 4 times a day.  He has prescribed Symbicort because he thinks the powder caused the problems, but I'm not going to get it because it looks that the side effects are just as bad, if not worse.

Was averaging every 2 months in the ER or a week in the hospital, have not been to either in 11 months.  Only been to the doctor for being sick once.

Ive been on it for two weeks now and have noticed I am actually able to do more activity than I had been.  Obviously the drug is new so I cant speak for long term treatment but if it lives up to what its approved for then it will do wonders for myself.  I experience numerous flar-ups a year and find myself in the ER at least once a year.  If Daliresp can prevent one or two of these a year it would really help my quality of life.  For now I would highly recommend this product,5,Male,"Diarrhea ,  weight loss ,  stomach / abdominal pain ,  nausea , loss of appetite,  headache , or  dizziness  may occur."
