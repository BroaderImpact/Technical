65-74,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,2008-01-24,methotrexate,20909,5,1,"I had a so called ""reaction"" to this medication and I believe anyone who is considering it for any disease should be very careful about side effects.  I started on a low dose and had some warning signs but because these side effects are so ""rare"" the doctor dismissed these signs as not related to the Methotrexate.  He doubled my dose to 7 mg and within 8 hours I was in the ER vomiting with diarrhea that was black and smelled extremely foul and like chemicals.  Everyone in the ER was sent to my room to help. I was in the hospital for five days. I had mouth sores, history of a gastric ulcer, history of sensitivity to medications.  I was being treated for lupus.  This medication may be very helpful for many people but sometimes I think the ""rare"" reactions are dismissed too regularly because they are so adamantly labeled ""RARE.""  I am also afraid that many cases of these kind of reactions are under reported after all the official studies are done where somehow the rare side effects are overlooked.  My advice is to be very careful and take it slowly with this drug.     It's tempting to say only bad things about this drug considering the hell I went through because of it.  It might be that this drug might help a lot of people with serious disease with agonizing symptoms.  But when you read about it in detail, it is pretty scary what can happen to you.  You better have a very good doctor who can pick up on the nuances of your disease and what are truly VERY IMPORTANT side effects.  Good luck to you all.",1,Female,"Nausea ,  vomiting ,  stomach pain , drowsiness, or  dizziness  may occur."

There have been intermittent times that I've had to take as much as 80mgs of it, although I did get a little puffy-faced and bloated it wasn't horrible. I did have lots of mood changes but that was worth it considering before I took it I couldn't get out of bed, take a shower, opening anything was impossible and I needed help eating and changing my clothes. Mind you, I was only 27 at the time of my first flare up and 28 at the second. Both were hell, so I'll deal with the side effects of maybe being a little nutty or maybe in the future needing a hip replacement because right now my quality of life is waaay better. Today for the first time I got a test reading that my sedimentation rate was ZERO...totally awesome. 
  So, in short, listen to what your body's telling you, eat right, drink lots of water and get rest when you can. Be prepared to be moody and have trouble sleeping for a bit while you adjust. Let others around you know what's going on so you don't seem like you're just acting like a lunatic for no reason.

I just wanted to say that in my experience with the drug a key factor to avoiding a lot of the side effects is to drink A LOT of water. There have been intermittent times that I've had to take as much as 80mgs of it, although I did get a little puffy-faced and bloated it wasn't horrible. I did have lots of mood changes but that was worth it considering before I took it I couldn't get out of bed, take a shower, opening anything was impossible and I needed help eating and changing my clothes. Mind you, I was only 27 at the time of my first flare up and 28 at the second. Both were hell, so I'll deal with the side effects of maybe being a little nutty or maybe in the future needing a hip replacement because right now my quality of life is waaay better. Today for the first time I got a test reading that my sedimentation rate was ZERO...totally awesome. 
  So, in short, listen to what your body's telling you, eat right, drink lots of water and get rest when you can. Be prepared to be moody and have trouble sleeping for a bit while you adjust. Let others around you know what's going on so you don't seem like you're just acting like a lunatic for no reason.

This causes the bone to die and then collapse in on itself, causing excruciating pain and disability.

Plaquenil can make you completely blind! 
       *Legitimate looking vitamins I take to help remediate it

I took Plaquenil for over 13 years and it caused me (and 6 in every 1000 patients, new research shows) to have toxic maculopathy it caused. *re: even if you quit taking the drug, it can continue to damage the eye until blindness occurs.
If you are taking it, make sure your physician is using the NEW guidelines on treatment ==I think it is no more than 5 milligrams per kilogram (For example just heard an example on this video if under 140 pounds you shouldnâ€™t be on 400 miligrams â€”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D35uZA-vjPY )  


Friends: If you have ANY changes in your vision, friends,  head to a retinal specialist--1 test I had an angiogram done.

My first retina specialist said i could be blind in 20 years without telling me the odds of that happening or giving me hope
My 2nd retina specialist doctor thinks that, since I have had very little deterioration since stopping the drug 18 months ago, I may be one of the fortunate ones that only have some damage. 

All I thought Plaquenil could do to my eyes was to cause them to lose color vision. I never truly understand what the Humphrey Visual Field Test was (and it is very rudimentary, my current retina specialist doctor said. If you have ANY changes on this test, be accessed by to a retinal specialist 

It did work well to make my Lupus/Scleroderma is more symptomatic 

 Are there any support groups or experimental therapies for toxic maculopathy?

*I am looking for experimental treatments or for information sharing on this!

I found  EyePromise Restore Vitamins that I take for retina health== those particular vitamins seems highly rated on all websites and that my retina specialist recommends â€”they are backed by 2 studies cited on their website called the Ares studies

Even if I slept it was unbearable). I've been on it a year, reluctantly. I do not want to have to be maintained on any chemicals or pills. Now that I've been on it a year the only thing that has improved is fatigue. But I""m not sure if it's because the flare passed or because of plaquenil.

I informed doctor and he said to reduce to 600mg daily but the problem persisted.  Now down to 400mg daily.  Gastro problems not so severe now.  My SLE symptoms were minor (Sjogren's symptoms primarily) and Prednisone actually solved it after a month.  Now off the Prednisone.  Recent blood tests, however, have shown an increase in creatinine levels (1.4 up from 1.0)  for the first time (also have well-controlled Type II Diabetes).  Can't seem to find out if the Plaquenil is the culprit.  Still working on that. No other real symptoms of Lupus (also have Sjogren's and APL Syndromes).  I really don't know if this drug is working or not since my symptoms leaned more towards a problem with Sjogren's.  Frankly, this drug scare me a little...especially with the possibility of retina problems (and even worse worries at 700mg).  I've been on Plaquenil for about 2-3 months.  No joint pain, no rashes, just a family history, positive ANA and antibody presence for all three.   I'll keep taking 400mg daily until the Rheumy says not to but I really don't know if its needed.",3, ,"Nausea ,  stomach   cramps , loss of appetite,  diarrhea ,  dizziness , or  headache  may occur."

I know this medication has bad reviews but after a few years of using the medication with a dose 600mg and above you risk these side effects. Plus Patients are supposed to get an eye exam every six moths while on medication to catch these sign early. I was diagnosed with SLE at 18 years old and it changed my life. I rated the the satisfaction 4 out of 5 because it takes  a couple months to actually change your immune system to rid the SLE symptoms. Also when get off schedule or stop taking it for a while you do start to experience SLE symptoms again. And my last reason is for the possibility of the eye side effects. But with Medications such as this you have to choose whether you want to feel sick everyday for the rest of the life and cope with the symptoms or take the medicine to feel alive again. I personally have never experienced a full blown flare up and because of that my doctor put me on the medication until I'm 21 too lower the risk of ever having a full-blown flare up for the rest of my life. I will not continue this medication after that window to not put myself at risk for eye toxicity. Everyone is different and medications affect them differently but most of these post against the medication are from people who have taken the medication for over 10 years and are of an older age when the body starts to have to work harder to consume the medication. Other than that, I would recommend this medication for a couple years, not for a life-long treatment.",4, ,"Nausea ,  stomach   cramps , loss of appetite,  diarrhea ,  dizziness , or  headache  may occur."

Surgery has brought back SOME sight...but little. RUN FROM THIS MEDICATION!!!  I had NO SYMPTOMS of eye problems until the eye went completely blind OVERNIGHT. If you ARE on this medication...SEE AN EYE SURGEON TWICE A YEAR to assess the retina...very involved exam, but might save the eye before much damage is done...which you cannot notice yourself...the retina is around the BACK of the eyeball itself.  I did NOT see an eye surgeon annually...and my rheumatologist never stressed it or insisted on it.  If I had it to do over again...I WOULD NOT TOUCH THIS MEDICATION although it gave me MUCH RELIEF from the systemic Lupus arthritis pain which is EXCRUCIATINGLY BAD.

25-34,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,2010-06-27,plaquenil,6986,4,4,"I am a 30 year old female with a 10 year history of SLE and Sjogren Syndrome. My lupus was properly diagnosed in 2008, until then all kinds of theories were tested of what my illnesses were. Since 2004 my condition began to worsen, since 2007 quite dramatically, until the diagnosis. Steroids were used at first. The pain subsided only temporarily, weight gain followed. At the beginning of this year Plaquenil was prescribed to keep my lupus from flaring up. I haven't noticed a very significant difference with the flares. With the pain and general feeling well, I find it is connected more to the monthly cycle. After the beginning dose, I now take one 200 mg dose at night, one in the morning. If I don't eat with it, it causes nausea, dizziness. My hairloss has not stopped, my joint pain has (lupus comes hand in hand with RA and nerve pain like in fibromyalgia). I do find flares can be controlled by the type of diet we follow: meat and milk products in moderation, same with anything acidic; but plenty of fruits and vegetables, with the exception of mushrooms and alfalfa. The first is hard to digest, the second triggers flares. My vision has worsened significantly: I cannot wear my contact lenses. The optometrist said one of my eyes cannot produce enough moisture and after one day of wear it gets inflamed. It doesn't help that I have Sjogren's ( chronic dry eyes and mouth) and astigmatism in that eye.  Even the special eye drops don't help, and this sort of dryness  affects vision adversely. They are considering a surgery to plug the tearducts to help my eyes produce enough 'tears' for my eyes to see better.
Lastly, at about the same time I began taking Plaquenil I began having a runny nose and sneezing a lot. At first we thought it was a cold, but it stayed for weeks...and despite medication. Then the spring passed by. My doctor suggested allergies, which I never had. Still puzzled. Have any of you had similar symptoms to this last one?

45-54,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,2010-05-28,plaquenil,6986,5,1,"An extremely rare allergic reaction to this drug called Stevens-Johnson Syndrome very nearly killed me sixteen years ago. A reheumalogist declared my lupus to be 'wildly out of control'and prescribed Plaquenil. He said that if my face should happen to turn 'red like a lobster', to call him immediately. After two doses, I knew that something was very wrong and went to see him that same morning. He took one look at me, handed me a prescription for a massive amount of Demerol and told me to go home, that I would be very ill. (He was a real compassionate guy!) That was at 10am. At that point, I looked like I had a bad case of acne. By 10pm, I did look like a lobster and could not drink enough water. I was in pain all over; it felt like my skin was being pulled off my body. By 3am, my skin WAS starting to slough off like a third-degree burn over at least half of my body. The pain was excruciating. The local emergency room admitted me as an inpatient and got three IV's running-two for fluid rehydration and one for a drip Demerol. Solumedrol was added later in the day. Very few practitioners know what Stevens=Johnson Syndrome is, much less have seen it at any stage. Sadly, it is not as rare as it used to be. Many of the new pharmaceuticals are causing a variation of SJS that involves damage to the linings of internal organs. If you or your family medical history runs toward allergies or auto-immune diseases, do your homework before popping that new pill. It could save you or someone you love a very painful traumatic experience, maybe even save a life.",1,Female,"Nausea ,  stomach   cramps , loss of appetite,  diarrhea ,  dizziness , or  headache  may occur."

Hi, 48 African American female- I began taking the pill in Jan. 2007 -I had a bad finger flare. I had the pills since late December 2006 - afraid to take, due to the side affects. I took 400mgs of plaquenil and popped lots of Ibuprofen/daily and together it relieved the aches and pain.I also notice I had a patch of hair that stayed shorter than other parts. I kept my hair short and it alway grew back in the same pattern. I believe it was the plaquenil- Dr's advice Bioten, it didn't help much. Anyhow, in 2008 I continued the use 400 mgs plaqenil and no Ibuprofen was need-felt awesome. Late 2008, I have noticed itchy skin even in my vaginal area -Derms say dry skin.  Dr's permission reduce to 200mgs and so far so good and still no Ibuprofen needed. Derm said take zyrtec durning day benadryl at night -works! My skin appears to be sensative, every now and then I get red patches on my face and ear area and I can tell they are there because I feel warm, but then they fade away -strange.  ecbanks60@comcast.net",5,Female,"Nausea ,  stomach   cramps , loss of appetite,  diarrhea ,  dizziness , or  headache  may occur."

My issue is the constant brain fog and forgetfulness. It is almost like looking in from the outside of my life. Very strange. I became depressed, detached, anxious, and pretty much a different person. As a full time college student, it is not worth it for me to take if I can't really focus in class or remember small details. I took benlysta subcutaneously and boy do those injections hurt. It made me nervous everytime I had to inject myself because it burns so bad as the medicine is going in. I would bruise after every injection, and get leg pain and muscles spasms for the following couple of days. One benefit I did see was a burst of energy immediately after I injected myself, but it was almost like a feverish energy where I would get super sweaty and seemingly over exert myself and then the energy would soon go away and the extreme fatigue returned. I currently take methotrexate subcutaneously as well and it is much easier for me to inject myself with a needle, and much less painful than Benlysta.

This drug has given me so much hope I was having 60 grand mal seizures a year due to my lupus and this drug along with some seizure medicine has stopped them where no seizure medicine was- my only wish is that it would last the full month I get joint pain after 3 weeks and I am quite miserable for the last week until my next treatment - I think it should cycle every 3 weeks but I'm being selfish because I just want a pain free life I've been doing this 25 years and I'm tired.

However, around month 4, I noticed that about a week before my next infusion, Pain increases, joints hurt, like my body knows it is time for the next infusion.

 ,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,2014-10-25,benlysta vial,155458,3,3,"I was one of the first patients in the United States to take Benlysta in June 2011.  I had to slow the infusions down to three hours instead of one and half hours.  I experienced nausea and an mild sort of asphasia ( a sort of muddled thinking) and a headache.  I was also tired after the infusions.  Each time I had an infusion (6 total) my temperature would rise about a degree and I felt discomfort in the abdominal/ bladder region.  I did inform my doctors but they did not seem concerned at all. The discomfort only occurred after the Benlysta infusions!  eventually it did turn out to be serious and this is why I'm writing this review.  Though rare, the drug lowered my immunity and my appendix abscessed and spread throughout my abdomen and I almost died.  I am not a drama queen.  Anyone with lupus has suffered enough usually to be stoic and if anything quiet about suffering. I did go see several doctors and no one looked deeper into my concerns but in the end the doctors did say they thought it was related to the drug,  a very low-grade infection could have been brewing before I took the drug.  I do not see a lot of comments with this experience so I do hope they post mine as I would like people to be fair warned to watch very closely what is going on with their body and not dismiss any pain or fever while taking Benlysta.  Sadly, I did feel more energy even though I was apparently ill after taking the Benlysta infusions.  ",2,Female,"Nausea ,  diarrhea , or  trouble sleeping  may occur."

These are the worst the first week to week and a half after my treatment and the week before my next treatment. Other wise I do okay. I have noticed that the discoed the lupus is also getting a lot better I had it all over my body and now the places are flaking off and going away. It is really helping my Lupus, but since I have several more autoimmune illnesses I am not having the same reaction as most of the others. I am usually down for 1-2 weeks after a treatment but then i get to feeling some better unless I am having a flair with one of the others.

Benlysta doesn't ""cure"" all my symptoms--I continue to require steroid injections in my joints and taking plaquenil.  But I would say that Benlysta did, in fact, change my life for the better.  I was diagnosed with SLE 25 years ago and have been treated with plaquenil and other meds during that time.  But with Benlysta I have more energy and am less depressed than previously.

35-44,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,2013-12-16,benlysta vial,155458,5,5,"I was diagnosed with SLE 20 years ago and have never been in ""remission"" since.  I have had times that were worse than others with a SIGNIFICNT flare every 10 years- on the nose.  The mix of Cellcept, methotrexate, steriods, Plaquinil and a variety of other juicy meds have lead me to live a relatively normal life, barring the 10-year flares.  
This last flare was by far the worst with both pain, indescribable exhaustion and cognitive delay.  The fatigue and delay seemed simply debilitating especially considering my line of work and position.  With an anti DNA of >200 that would not respond to anything, the Rheumatologist convinced me to give Benlysta a go.   
1rst session- felt like I had hit by a FREIGHT train the next day.  Day 2, however; I felt like I could take on the world.  The week after was a mix of decreased  appetite, slight nausea and diarrhea.  Nothing worth stopping the drug for.
The rest of my loading doses had a similar outcome, less severe each time.  Then came my first 4-week cycle.  For 3 weeks after my last loading dose I felt on top of the world!  My former energy level had returned as had my mental sharpness- I was so pleased.  Then EXACTLY the week before my next infusion, I just crashed.  Back was the exhaustion, pain, inability to think.
I was so ready for my next dose!
After that highly anticipated does, the next day was another freight train event.  I could barely get out of bed with a headache that rivaled a migraine.  But the second day- I was back to ruling the world.  And this time- it lasted until 2 days before my next dose.  And itâ€™s been like that ever sense.  With each treatment the â€œday afterâ€ seems less severe.  Clearly itâ€™s building up in the old system.  All in all- 3 bad days out of 30?  Iâ€™LL TAKE IT!! 
The cost of Benlysta is a draw back, but if you can afford it- itâ€™s life changing and I canâ€™t say enough positive things!
GOOD LUCK!
