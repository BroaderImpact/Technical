    "We have contrived this example based on analyses that Murmuration sometimes conducts for our clients. Please provide the details of your analysis (including your code), as well as any discussion points describing assumptions, limitations, caveats, and next steps using a medium of your choice (e.g., slides, document, Jupyter note­book). Feel free to include any other interesting analytic results that you uncover. Please take as long as you need to finish this exercise, but we are anticipating ~4 hours of work. Please send us the results of the analysis within 72 hours after you receive it. Although these data have been scrubbed to remove the obviously identifying characteristics, they are by no means fully anonymized, so please delete these files after the completion of the exercise and do not share the data or analysis. Please do not upload the data/analyses or report to github. "
