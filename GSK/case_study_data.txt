97013	Ambien	"Ditto on rebound sleepless when discontinued. I have done very strange things with no memory including taking additional Ambien. It has helped me sleep when under extreme stress but watch out. Now I am trying to learn how to sleep naturally."	13-Jan-15
141462	Escitalopram	"I am a 22 year old female college student. I wanted to write this because when I was at my lowest of low when I felt absolutely hopeless... these positive reviews are what got me through the day. I experienced a lot of change.  I was also in a relationship that made me unhappy. I stopped doing the things I liked to do such as run, party, work, hang out with friends etc. In result, I never had energy. I constantly felt guilty. I cried everyday, sometimes multiple times of day. I went to group therapy. I dropped 10lbs in two weeks. I eventually got on this medicine &amp; the first 4 days felt crazy &amp; tired! TAKE AT NIGHT. Give this medicine time! Now 3 weeks in I am back to myself and am truly happy! Keep your head up."	29-Apr-14
95748	Sertraline	"I had major depression from the time I started menstruating.  It would cycle with my cycle.  It caused paranoia, and fear of being seen outside my home.  It feared going to my mail box, yet, at times I would sign up to do things like be an Avon Lady! I felt crazy. In my mid 30&#039;s, divorced, alcoholic, my doctor prescribed Prozac.  It didn&#039;t seem to help me.  Later in recovery but still profoundly depressed, she put me on Zoloft and the result was instantaneous.  I felt like a window to my life had been opened.  I wasn&#039;t afraid.  I looked forward to getting out of bed.  I found things I liked to do. I have a healthy relationship, a good job, a life.  I have been given my life back.  Now, I am 16 years sober.  Thank you Zoloft."	2-Nov-14
128575	Phentermine	"Started out yesterday at 242 and this morning I was only 239.6 not hungry at all"	7-Jun-15
138742	Phentermine	"I absolutely LOVE this medicine. I lost 30 pounds on it last year and have lost 7 lbs on it in the last month (no exercise). It makes me feel good and gives me the energy to get things done. My libido had been down due to being on anti-depressants BUT this medicine has affected my libido in a GOOD way. It also helps tremendously because I have ADHD. It helps so much with that too. I love this medicine.  HOWEVER don&#039;t drink a lot when you take it. When I first started it last April I drank WAY too much and ended up in the hospital. The doctor was amazed that they hadn&#039;t told me not to drink on it but all is well now."	18-May-11
140925	Escitalopram	"Very good for GAD mixed with depression. I felt worse for 2 months but then felt amazing :) give it a chance"	21-Dec-15
72043	Tramadol	"This medication does not relieve eve the slightest pain."	2-Jun-15
214584	Escitalopram	"First off let me start off by saying that I am only here because before I started this medication I lived and died by the reviews on here. As a matter of fact had it not been for the reviews I probably never would have taken the chance and been A LOT worse off. If your reading this you&rsquo;re probably at the point where you know you should take this medicine but anxiety is telling you it will harm or kill you. Don&rsquo;t listen to it. It&rsquo;s LYING. This medicine took me from being agoraphobic to attending rock concerts. It doesn&rsquo;t work overnight and the side effects DID suck but they were worth every single one. I have my life back and my only regret is that I waited so long to try. I started in May and by October I was basically a brand new person."	25-Nov-17
64109	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve had depression on and off for years but more recently have felt worse. Having tried various antidepressants my Dr prescribed 50mg of sertraline. I started it a few days ago and have noticed that I have no appetite. I sleep for only a few hours a night. But it&#039;s early days.."	28-Apr-17
72195	Tramadol	"I take it for gastrointestinal pain and it works fairly well. My pain often gets to the point of me wanting to punch everything in sight, and tramadol helps to quiet it. The only downsides are that it takes a little longer to start working than I need it to, since this unbearable pain can arise in a few minutes. Additionally, it causes constipation even in low doses, which can contribute to further gastrointestinal pain."	31-May-14
96970	Ambien	"I have been prescribed Ambien for 3 years now, I used to take Xanax along with it so I never truly got to experience the hypnotic effects of Ambien on its own. Now I take it by itself and its a powerful medication. It can cause my appetite to get out of control, also  I had a major problem when I drank alcohol with it . My parents came home to find me, putting all my clothes in a suitcase I found somewhere in the house, a loaf of sliced bread spread all over the house and the yard, and me yelling at them for making my friends leave the game early, what the hell I was doing or talking about I still have no idea. So yes, don&#039;t drink and take Ambien in the course of a night because it leads to some bizarre activities. But all in all as a sleep aid it&#039;s great."	14-Nov-15
72178	Tramadol	"Just recently prescribed Tramadol 50 mg and it has been the miracle medicine for my osteoarthritis pain.  The very first dose &amp; I was able to move without any issues.  I am only 42 yrs old and fear being crippled due to this nasty disease.  I am hoping this medicine will continue to work for me.  Hydrocodone 5-325 just wasn&#039;t cutting it for me anymore, needed something stronger as the pain was getting truly unbearable.  I would recommend others to try it.  I&#039;ve read a lot of reviews and have seen mixed reviews but for the most part others are happy with the results like myself."	1-Aug-14
97320	Ambien	"I have a friend who had taken ambien for years without any problems. For whatever reason he had an episode where he took his pill and then remembers nothing until he was at the police station. He had drank three beers (which he only knows because that&#039;s all that was in his frig) then proceded to drive (!!) and ended up crashing into another parked car. This is scarey stuff, eh? It works wonderfully, but I surely wouldn&#039;t want to have a blackout and end up driving. Is there any class action suit against this drug? I&#039;ve heard of the other stories -- walking naked in the winter cold, eating while sleeping, and then my friend&#039;s experience."	4-Oct-09
139178	Phentermine	"This drug is amazing. I lost 20lbs in 2 months."	9-Sep-08
96811	Ambien	"I was prescribed Ambien, then later Ambien CR, for several years for insomnia.  Wow!  Just like I&#039;d heard about -- take the pill and 20 minutes later I was out.  Didn&#039;t really experience &quot;hangover&quot; the next day, but then I allowed myself 7 +/- hours of sleep.  Then, it happened:  woke up one morning and my kitchen was somewhat of a mess but I didn&#039;t remember being up or making tuna salad on toast.  That happened a few more times before I weaned myself off Ambien.  Haven&#039;t had a good night&#039;s sleep since.  I&#039;ve been prescribed a few different sleep meds but haven&#039;t had any success.  Tried OTC diphenhydramine (Benadryl, Motrin PM) with Melatonin and began not remembering simple words, appointments, etc."	21-Nov-16
138923	Phentermine	"I&#039;m a 39 yr old man 6&quot; 250 lbs.  Started phentermine 37.5 November 30th, my doctor put me on one pill in the morning and a half in the afternoon. I have lost 5.4 pounds in a week. Side effects with me are dry mouth, hard to sleep the first few nights, slight tingling in my arms. It does suppress my appetite and that&#039;s what I need."	6-Dec-09
128788	Phentermine	"I loved the product! I started June 1, 2014 to August 2014. IN 2 MONTHS I HAD LOST 30 LBS! I was doing Zumba 3 times a week and had a personal trainer to help tone my body with my new found ENERGY. The Personal Trainer was a waste because Adipex with Zumba was doing a tremendous job all on its own. I wasn&#039;t craving sweets thanks to Adipex. I cut out fast foods, carbs, and late night eating. Plus I drank anywhere from 1/2 to a gallon A DAY! However, the medicine still made me constipated. I started at 244 and got down to 209lbs. I stopped using it for about 5 months AND THE WEIGHT STAYED OFF, while not eating so healthy. "	24-Jan-15
138646	Phentermine	"Today is my 2nd day taking this pill.  I have had dry mouth and was unable to sleep throughout the whole night last night.  I do not feel energy at all, in fact, since I didn&#039;t sleep, I didn&#039;t even want to get out of bed today.  I&#039;ve had a bad headache today, and feel a bit nauseated too.  I&#039;m going to keep trying it, but just wanted to go over some side effects after my 1st day on it.  I hope to lose weight though"	8-Mar-12
72037	Tramadol	"I think there is a reason the government has made Tramadol a category C drug...they want people in society to take it but everybody in society just wants to get high. Tramadol is the best DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, MILD PAIN MEDICINE EVER. This actually is better than everything without the high. If you actually wanna be a happy person without being high, this is it. 50 mg am- optional second until next day. Forget the critics. I would say this is like adderal, without the hunger side effects, lack of sleep, personality disorder, grumpyness, depression, etc etc etc. The best thing about it is the government is only selling it for $4 dollars. You don&#039;t even need health insurance."	8-Jun-15
140520	Escitalopram	"Supposed to be 6 weeks to take effect. I felt instantly calmer, happen the NEXT day! Couldn&#039;t believe it. Started at 10mg moved to 20 MG in year of use. My problem now is  its been 7 years of working for me but 20mg doesn&#039;t have same effect of earlier years. I want to have  increase in MG use. How to I get doctor to do this?"	18-Jan-17
140747	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve been taking lexapro for about a year now and it seems to help a lot with my social anxiety. I don&#039;t think about nor care what people think as much as I used to. But it does make me kinda have like no emotion toward people&#039;s feeling &amp; what not. Which is a downside. But I used to be afraid of big crowds. I wouldn&#039;t really want to be around people but at the same time I did because I wanted to have friends and be outgoing but it was extremely hard for me. Also I had like mild depression, always negative thoughts. But since I&#039;ve been taking it it&#039;s definitely made me more positive and more friendly. Before I would always worry about everything and when I say everything I mean everything lol. With out it I do have bad withdrawal &amp; it sucks."	22-Jul-16
64431	Sertraline	"I suffer from harm-ocd (violent impulsive thoughts), and im taking Zoloft for almost 2 years now. Im currently 23 years old. Here is my review..    It helped me much but it didnt eliminate OCD. Though, it reduced anxiety and the frequency my mind produces impulsive thoughts with. In the past, i had pains in the back side of my head and Zoloft made them go away.    Nonetheless, I also had some side effects. If i take it late at night, it will cause me tension making it hard for me to sleep. Additionally, i feel like its much harder for me to climax during sex. I still can ofcourse, but i need to put the double effort."	22-Jun-16
64412	Sertraline	"I have been using setter alone now for around 4 years and they help with my mood and anxiety, I am on 100mg, 1 tablet a day. My hair has gone extremely thin, losing loads each day, via combing; I thought initially it was after having my son who is nearly 4 years old, as hair loss can be associated after bearing a child but its getting worse, to the point where my daughter said gosh mum that&#039;s not normal, your hair comes out in clumps!   I am rather worried as may be it could be the medication?  Plus Iv put on weight and my appetite has increased! Iv put on 3 stone since having my son.   I think I&#039;m going to reduce the amount gradually and stop taking it as il end up more depressed if these symptoms continue!"	23-Aug-16
139104	Phentermine	"I&#039;ve been using phentermine to lose the remainder of my baby weight. It&#039;s been 2 weeks and I have lost 14lbs I do exercise and already eat right but after I lost the first 50lbs, I turned to this for a plateau breaker it broke my plateau and its helping me get back within navy standards with nothing to worry about. I recommend this to anyone who fully understands the effects of this controlled drug and has a very good understanding of healthy eating and the importance of exercise. Please note that this is a temporary medication - it is not meant to be used past a 12 week period during this time you are supposed to learn how to make healthier lifestyle choices. "	26-Jan-09
95684	Sertraline	"I&#039;m very surprised at what this medication has done for me. I have been prescribed an SSRI multiple times but never took one because I was convinced my feelings of guilt and anxiety were appropriate reactions to my failures in life. I have lived a bohemian life chasing contentment and self respect. In a new relationship and questioned by my partner about my inconsolable sense of unhappiness, I realized I needed to try something other than running away so in a last ditch move, signed up for a depression study that has given me 6 mos of Zoloft medication. I have clarity now I haven&#039;t experienced in a decade, it is wonderful and sobering because I realize now how serious chemical depression is. Don&#039;t self medicate, it&#039;s OK to get help!"	5-Dec-14
96242	Sertraline	"I have been on Zoloft for about 6 weeks. I was experiencing depression which manifested itself in crying spells, anger, helplessness and loss of motivation. It took approximately 4 weeks for me to notice any changes,  but I have noticed recently that I have motivation once again and I have not experienced any side effects which i was dreading such as loss of sexual desire and weight gain.  I feel like my normal self again and able now to handle the issues of my life  Prior to this I was sad a lot and having many crying bouts.  I haven&#039;t noticed any negative side effects whatsoever."	20-Mar-12
127805	Phentermine	"Just started Phentermine, I weight 284lbs!! I am 28 years old. This is the heaviest I have ever weighed. I want my life back in control and I want to feel beautiful again! Wish me luck!!"	29-Jan-17
95884	Sertraline	"Took 2 weeks to feel a bit better.  Stick with it through side effects. I take 62.5 mg in the morning and 25 mg in evening now.  After 5 months I feel pretty good."	13-May-14
64185	Sertraline	"I have suffered from Panic disorder and OCD since the age of 18.. Been on medication but stopped when I was 28 due to my pregnancy - Anyhow, 2016 of April I was prescribed Generic Lexapro, keep in mind the brand name worked wonders! The generic was a horrible experience.. Now its my 3rd day of switching to Sertraline 50mg.. The switch has been amazing so far! I feel so much better already."	9-Mar-17
140973	Escitalopram	"So to start, Im not affiliated with any med companies, nor is this some fake bs review. I was you, scanning reviews all night long, just two weeks ago. I have a HUGE personal phobia of medication, in dread of any adverse side effects... and my anxiety has also come back with a vengeance over the last 2 years, and began controlling my life.     I started on 5mg generic. People say it&#039;s placebo at this dose....everyone is different. I can tell you a few things: The 9th day on it I had realized most of my anxiety was gone &amp; all my emotions, sex drive, were all in tact. 1 major problem... Insomnia for every single night, and night sweats. Couldn&#039;t sleep for more than 3 hours a night. Helped, but not the right med for me due to this. Try it!"	26-Mar-16
138373	Phentermine	"I started taking phentermine on February 14, 2014, Since then I have lost at least fifteen pounds and it has not even been a whole month yet, this is awesome, I work night shift so it keeps me up all night and gives me plenty of energy, I hardly ever get a chance to work out because I have three children that crave a lot of attention, this stuff is the best thing since sliced bread! I don&#039;t think about eating, I will force myself to eat a little bit of something healthy every few hours, the side effects were scarey the first two days but after that my body pretty much got used to them. Anyone looking to lose weight this is most definitely a jump start way!"	1-Mar-14
127894	Phentermine	"I am 227 lbs and 5&#039;3&quot;. I started taking the Adipex 37.5 today (11-18-16) at 7:30 am. I could tell that I took it because I was very talkative, and not energetic as in bouncing off the walls or nothing, but more like I actually had the energy to do my work and I was really focused on it. Done more today at work than I done all week. Only thing I have a problem with is when I ate it felt like I slowed down, and all my energy was gone. Maybe it want be like this the whole time. I will keep ya&#039;ll updated on my progress."	18-Nov-16
139150	Phentermine	"I am 5&#039;2 and 210lbs as of yesterday. I have been taking Phentermine 15mg for 30 days only. Today is my 2nd day and I have only experienced dry mouth and a little more energy. I have read that people have a lot more energy and don&#039;t think about eating. Well yesterday I took the 1st pill at 5.55am and I was hungry by 10.30am and sleepy again by 12noon. I tried taking a nap around 7 but couldn&#039;t get to sleep. Went to bed around 11.30pm slept fine. I am hoping to lose 65lbs but I will settle for 55lbs. I just wish the doctor would have started me on a higher dosage. I am drinking a lot of water and I plan on working out on the Wiifit for 1 hour a day. I will write back in 2 weeks if I lose any weight."	16-Apr-09
128091	Phentermine	"I am a 31 yr old female, I weighed in at 207lbs and a height of 5&#039;3. I started taking Phentermine 30mg around May 15th. I went in for a 30 day check up and I was down 17lbs. I wasnt hungry at all, most days I wouldn&#039;t feel like eating untill lunchtime, then I would take a pill with a bottle of water before lunch then eat a small lunch, and an even smaller dinner.  I would try to walk for 20-30 minutes a day, sometimes more, sometimes I wouldn&#039;t get a chance to walk at all. The doctor was very pleased, as was I. He perscribed me for another 30 day perscription... But... I have done everything the same this round and haven&#039;t lost any weight at all. I have even threw in some extra walking. Has anyone else experienced this?"	13-Jul-16
95937	Sertraline	"I have struggled with obsessive compulsive disorder since I was 6 years old hiding it from family and friends because I had no idea what was going on when I was little. I then got so stressed I had shooting pain through my whole body and went on Cymbalta for 6 months then got off of it and was back to normal with no pain, just OCD. I then got sick with vomiting, couldn&#039;t eat, felt scared to be alone. My doctor told me it was anxiety. He gave Zoloft 25 mg and stared me on it really slow. I am on 50mg and a half once a day and I am back to normal....no vomiting or no bad thoughts. I still have some bad moments of OCD but they don&#039;t last long. I have recommend this to people! I am 26 years old and finally can enjoy my life."	13-Aug-13
72257	Tramadol	"This has helped my mom along with gabapentin for her disc problems. "	30-Jun-12
71832	Tramadol	"I have RLS and my legs really hurts at night, even at days but not as much.   my wifes mother Gave me a Tramadol that she use fore her back pain, i sleep like a baby,  i fall a sleep really Quick and have a really nice sleep, when i dont take it i cant sleep at night. 100mg to 200mg will do it."	9-Apr-16
71703	Tramadol	"Well besides depression I battled with eating disorders my whole life. I never knew of this Med until 2 years ago. It really has helped me with my ED , anxiety, mood and energy! Sadly it&#039;s hard to get a prescription because is more of a narcotic"	10-May-17
97010	Ambien	"Due to a painful disability the only way to sleep is with the use of Ambien. I give Ambien a two thumbs up, AAA   , it works terrific for me."	11-Feb-15
97194	Ambien	"I have been taking Ambien for 2 years now for insomnia and trouble sleeping.  It does make you tired, but you also feel really good and happy.  I would take it and an hour later, not remember anything. Also, I would still wake up every hour. It helped me fall asleep, but not stay asleep.  Recently, I over dosed on Ambien.  That is what really woke me up.  This is not for me.  I have been prescribed Seroquel for my sleeping problems and this is wonderful. I have no more sleepwalking and I remember everything."	20-Oct-10
96236	Sertraline	"After 1 week of loose bowels and strange stomach noises/sensations, week 2 came and the jaw clenching/teeth grinding sensation in my temples started. Along with throat pain and suicidal thoughts, it was tough to stick it out and stay on but I did. I started on 25mg then up to 50mg then on to 75mg by week 3. Things got better around then. I still felt anxious, but the medicine was blocking my physical response that my body would produce from stress and anxiety. I would get chest pains, stomach pains, head pains all the time, got checked out by every specialist under the sun, and I&#039;m a healthy 31 year old man with normal or better than normal heart, brain, lung and organ function. It was all in my head and Zoloft stopped my suffering."	8-Apr-12
140437	Escitalopram	"I was prescribed this med for GAD/anxiety. Worst 10 days of my life. Nausea, retching, dilated pupils, insomnia and vivid dreams, but worse yet near constant panic attacks. Coming off it now. I understand this drug helps many people. Unfortunately I was not one of them."	17-Jun-17
64386	Sertraline	"I told myself that if a miracle happened and this worked, that I would write a review. Let me start off by saying that this drug, literally, saved my LIFE. I&#039;ve always battled anxiety and panic attacks, and was on a small dose of Paxil and that seemed to take the edge off. I took it on and off for years. After I had my second baby at 28, I got terrible postpartum depression. I had thoughts of suicide, racing thought constantly, couldn&#039;t nap and took forever to fall asleep at night. I literally spent three months just thinking and obsessing over how horrible I felt. I wanted to crawl out of my skin and die. I was barely showering, brushing my teeth and hair and would stay in the same sweatpants and shirt for days. I could go on forever by I&#039;ll get to the point. After three months of pure hell, I went to my doctor for help. I was prescribed 50 ML of Zoloft. After being on it for 4 weeks, I stopped taking it because it wasn&#039;t working. After going another 2 weeks feeling miserable, I went to my doctor again.  She recommended we up the dose and stay on it for atleast 6 weeks. Well, after two weeks on 100 ML, I realized I was feeling better. I would go minutes without thinking negatively, then I would go hours, then full days. It feels SO good to feel like myself again. I truly thought I would be miserable forever. Please get help and try something if you are feeling terrible. Everyone is curable with the right drug and right dose. I wish I got help sooner. TRY THIS! It will work! If for some reason it doesn&#039;t, try something else! GET HELP NOW! I was doing the same thing you are - googling all types of antidepressants convinced there was no cure and they would never work. Stop spending your life wondering when you will be yourself again. You WILL get better and be 100% your old self again with an antidepressant!"	6-Sep-16
97178	Ambien	"I was having severe insomnia to the point where I was only getting 1-2 hours, at the most, of sleep a night. I started to hallucinate after a few days of this and was prescribed Ambien. It works fast (within 10 minutes after kicking in to fall asleep), but I only sleep 4-5 hours on it and then wake up refreshed. I don&#039;t get my full 7-8 hours. Not sure what&#039;s up with that. I tried Ambien CR and it took longer to fall asleep on that and I still only got around 4-5 hours of sleep on the CR version. I still use Ambien and it&#039;s better than Lunesta which gave me a nasty taste in my mouth and didn&#039;t even make me tired. Overall, I recommend Ambien."	9-Feb-12
138860	Phentermine	"Started this medicine 6 weeks ago and have lost 10 lbs. I have been watching my diet and walk/jog 2.5 miles 5 days a week with other exercises. I have a hypothyroidism making it very difficult to lose weight. Was on this medicine one other time 1.5 years ago for a month straight and realized that my body is immune to it after one week.  Now I take it 1 week on, 1 week off.  I notice lots of energy and dry mouth and a happy feeling for the first 4 days and then I start feeling sad, which then goes away in about 4 more days. I have also noticed vision changes in my right eye which I plan to see my eye doctor about.  All in all I recommend Phentermine as I would never have lost the weight or had the energy to make the necessary changes."	15-Aug-10
141998	Escitalopram	"I was put on this for my anxiety disorder and my bulimia/anorexia. I was put on 5 mg and than bumped up to 15 mg over a months times. I started this drug three months ago and last month I had to be taken off. I had bruises all over my legs, I had no energy, I would fall asleep at 10pm and wake up at noon the next day and be taking a nap at 3pm. My anxiety improved some but those side effects were too much."	16-Jun-09
128841	Phentermine	"I started Adipex a year ago. Lost 50lbs in 3mos. Then got pregnant. Had him 2 months ago. And only gained 15lbs during and lost right away. But I still didn&#039;t reach my goal. So I&#039;m on it again. I&#039;m on day 4 and down 5lbs. I love this pill! Never exercised or dieted before but I&#039;m going try this time."	2-Sep-14
72202	Tramadol	"Had an extremely painful foot condition, which turned out to be gout. The tramadol helped relieve the extreme pain."	29-Apr-14
96160	Sertraline	"Sertraline has helped me so much. About a year ago I took a phsyc. test with my doctor (phsycologist). I was recommended to go on medication by her and so I took my results to my actual doctor and went over it with her. She decided to first put me on Prozac, it made my depression ease but my anger way worse. So then she put me on sertraline. Now I&#039;m not so nervous around people. I used to always stay where I could see everyone but now I&#039;m more at ease with my anxiety and can function and talk smoothly. I don&#039;t get angry (barely anymore) and when I do it&#039;s not near as bad as it was. I used to be always sad too. But now it&#039;s like when I wake up, I&#039;m happy and wanting to do things again! Thank you Sertraline!"	26-Feb-12
95794	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve scrolled through about 3 pages of comments but I have failed to find one of the side effects I&#039;m now thankfully free of.  I had an INSATIABLE appetite for sugar, namely chocolate.  But if none happened to be available and I was desperate, I&#039;d just pour a cup of sugar and eat it with a spoon.  I actually lost weight during the time I took it, but every evening I&#039;d need to eat enough sugar for 10 people to curb the craving.  Secondly, it was TERRIBLE for sex drive.  Absolutely horrid.  Overall this medicine was helpful for me, I&#039;m in the process of dosing down now. which IS an awful process.  Make sure to do what your doctor says.  I&#039;m doing it the right way and still have insomnia, rapid heart beat and brain zaps."	13-Feb-14

72189	Tramadol	"This medicine worked decently. I&#039;ve recently had a spinal fusion due to blowing out my back from lifting weights for football. My L5 disk literally exploded and bone particles were seeping down my spine. This helped relieve the pain after surgery but I did build a tolerance quickly."	13-Jun-14
96366	Sertraline	"I&#039;m in my mid-40&#039;s and have been on Zoloft for six years. Anxiety gone...it no longer rules my life. I am able to go out in public and not feel like my world was going to end. Still am subject to turning inward at times..but doesn&#039;t everybody? I do notice some memory issues like really having to think longer about names and places. (Sometimes I feel like a slow computer trying to load a page!) Dosage has been 150mg."	7-Mar-10
140902	Escitalopram	"I was prescribed this drug for occasional anxiety issues, related to pressure at work. I took it during an extremely stressful time where I experienced extraordinary anxiety. The first day it helped me quite a lot, by taking away the negative feeling in my chest and making me more relaxed and social. Later in the day, it made me very awake, without impairing my sleep. I took it for another 4-5 days every day in 2.5-10mg to try with different dosage. The positive impact faded and I got serious problems with side effects. I could hardly sleep any longer and the combination with diphenhydramin (sleeping pill) made it even worse, by excessively reducing my heart rate and respiratory condition. The last 2 days i hardly slept, due to &#039;hypnic jerks"	16-Jan-16
138582	Phentermine	"I just turned 30 last month. I started Adipex in November 2012. Lost 10 lbs and thought I could keep going without the pills. Ended up gaining all the 10 back, plus another 10 after all the holidays. I was 230 lbs, 5ft 7 in. I got back on Adipex 4 weeks ago and I am now 210 lbs!! I only get to the gym maybe 3 times a week. I used to get dry mouth, so drank more water. I pretty much ate what I wanted, but a lot less of it considering the pills make me not hungry at all. So now starting strict diet, I should be able to lose more than 20 lbs a month!"	3-Mar-13
128510	Phentermine	"Hey guys I&#039;m back again I just finished my 1st week on Phen 37.5. And I have lost a total of 12.8 pounds. I did not skip any meals although I wasn&#039;t always hungry. I made sure to eat something. I was already a big water drinker before starting it just made me drink more because my throat was always dry. 270.1 to 257.3 from July 28th to Aug. 5th. I did experience severe constipation though but a little magnesium citrate fixed that up. Female 22"	5-Aug-15

141941	Escitalopram	"I&#039;m a 33 YO female, and this is my first time being on any kind of anti-depressant.  I&#039;ve been on Lexapro 10mg for about a month now.  I noticed an immediate increase in energy, and even felt a little jittery.  The doctor said it typically takes 2-3 weeks for it to fully kick in, but some people notice a change within 24-48 hours, which was me.  I have decreased appetite and a lot of foods upset my stomach, so I&#039;m eating less as well.  Subsequently, I&#039;ve lost some weight (which I like since I need to lose some!)  I feel like doing things again and actually have some sort of sex drive, which had been completely absent for a while with the depression.  I&#039;m sleeping better, and it&#039;s easier to get out of bed.  So far, so good."	17-Nov-09
128064	Phentermine	"I started Phen on March 23rd and weight 193.  As of June 27th, I weighed 169.  My goal weight is 155. (I&#039;m 5&#039;10&quot;) I took a whole pill for the first couple of weeks...but, experienced extreme side effects - jitters, cotton mouth, breathing irregularities, constipation etc.  I decreased my intake to 1/2 pill every morning and the side effect were more manageable.  I now take the weekends off on the pill and exercise when my schedule allows.  I eat extremely clean...Except for a couple of glasses of wine every now and then.  I&#039;ve also gotten the lipo shot 3 times since I&#039;ve been in Phen."	27-Jun-16

139200	Phentermine	"I&#039;m a 26 year old female and I started taking this medicine along with a fluid pill on 01/25/08. At my heaviest weighing 317 lbs, I tried everything under the sun and lost maybe 10 lbs maximum here and there, but it always came right back. When I began this medication I weighed 308 lbs. Its 07/16/08 I weigh 218 lbs. That&#039;s a 90 lb loss from the date I started and 99 lbs since my heaviest. I do excerise for around an hour several times a week. I eat almost anything I want just in small portions. I cry when I look in a mirror."	16-Jul-08
96935	Ambien	"I&#039;ve been taking Ambien for many years. The first year, I was prescribed 10 mg nightly. I had experienced a &quot;deep sleep&quot; and through the entire night. For the first time in my life, I didn&#039;t feel exhausted the next day. Then my dosage was changed to 5 mg, which was tough! My tolerance to the higher dose made it not work. My Dr. gave me something different to substitute while my body adjusted. It&#039;s not been 2 years, that I&#039;ve been taking the 5 mg. I also take Adderall XR @ 20 mg daily and 20 mg of Prozac. During the last 6 months, I&#039;ve had difficulty with memory. Being able to recall things I read, appointment times, things people had said to me. I am 52 years old, and I understand that comes with age. But has anyone had similar problems?"	14-Aug-16
96949	Ambien	"I&#039;ve been taking ambien for over 6 years. It helps me sleep and I can sleep 6 hrs and felt like I slept 10 hrs only bad thing is once commit to taking ambien I can&#039;t be bothered cuz I won&#039;t remember so I usually lock my self down but it is a very helpful drug"	31-Mar-16
64070	Sertraline	"I am taking Sertraline. Started about two months ago. It is a Rolla coaster. 50mg for now. Depression for me is a 30 year battle. I like the numbness it brings at times."	22-Jan-17
128914	Phentermine	"I took my first dose on May 10th, I dropped 9lbs immediately within the first 4 days without exercise, my side effects the first 3 days were dry mouth, excessive energy, slight difference in my heart rate, clammy and insomnia. Day 5 has been totally different and I started going to the gym again today.  My heart rate was still slightly higher and I ask have problems sleeping but everything else went away. I dropped 2 more pounds today from mowing the lawn and walking the treadmill for thirty minutes. I do have to make myself eat I&#039;m never hungry. I eat 6 times per day counting in at about 2000 calories a day. I watch my carb and sugar intake, but eat lots of dietary fiber and protein. My goal is 150 lbs, I started at 207 and I&#039;m now 196lbs."	14-May-14
96143	Sertraline	"I starting taking Zoloft after speaking to my doctor about my problems -- irritability, sadness, loss of sex drive, poor body image, etc.  She suggested we try this medication for one year at 50 mg a day.  Within 2.5 weeks, I started feeling better. I wasn&#039;t mad all the time and even managed to have sex again after a nine month hiatus. I felt much more confident and in control of my emotions. I even managed to lose 15 pounds and am still losing. I have experienced no side effects whatsoever."	27-Oct-11
138841	Phentermine	"I started using phentermine on 9/29/2010. I had my first check-up on the 29th of October, and was surprised to see that I had lost an amazing 28 pounds in just 4 short weeks.  The only side effect that I have had is the dry mouth, which I almost consider a good thing because it allows me to drink the water I have always needed to drink.  I have been so tempted to go and buy a scale for the house just to keep up on my weight loss more, but I really like the surprise when I step on that scale at the doctors. This pill is an answer to my prayers and I would recommend it to anyone who is serious about wanting to lose the weight."	4-Nov-10
96325	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been taking Zoloft for six weeks so far.  I started at 12.5 mg, advanced to 25 mg and am now at 37.5 mg.  I am increasing to the 50 mg tonight.  It was difficult at first with the side effects of a very sick stomach and increased nervousness.  I see a therapist and she explained to me that my increased nervousness is a result of my anxiety about taking the medicine to begin with!  At this point, I can honestly say I feel a big difference.  I am much more calm, and I feel like my mind is getting some rest.  I used to think WAY too much about everything.  It&#039;s nice.  The side effects are going away.  The sleep isn&#039;t fantastic but I get at least 6.5 hours so I&#039;ll take it. Overall, I&#039;m very happy and looking forward to whats to come."	7-May-10

138628	Phentermine	"My OBGYN just prescribed this medication based on 15% unexplained weight gain over the past 2 years due to peri-menopausal symptoms. I&#039;m 5&#039;10&quot; and weigh 140-145lbs. I have always maintained this weight even between and after both pregnancies. My youngest is now 5 years old and I&#039;m suddenly up to 168. I took my first dose on Tuesday (4/24) at 12:30pm. My doc warned me that if I may feel jittery (crawling out of my skin feeling) over the first few days. I&#039;m happy to report that I have had NO such ill side effect and sleeping better than before. As of this morning (4/27 Day 3) I am 165lbs. It is the best feeling I&#039;ve had in months! Make that years! It&#039;s the boost in confidence that I&#039;ve been so desperately seeking! Two thumbs up so far!"	27-Apr-12
142126	Escitalopram	"This pill works really well. Not for everyone but those that it will work on, it works great. Take effect in about 2 to 3 weeks."	28-Sep-08
64244	Sertraline	"I switched from Pristiq which was keeping me up at night. My initial dose was 50 mg. it was hell the first week: crying spells panick attacks but my doc promised it will improve. After I bumped it up to 100 mg the hell got worse; panick attacks&amp; anxiety were unbearable but I kept telling myself to stick with it. So, I did until the end of week 2 on higher dose when I was hospitalized with seizures due to serotonin syndrome. Still taking Ativan 1 mg every 5-6 hours for seizures. Not a good experience."	14-Nov-16
63962	Sertraline	"I was put on 50mg daily, but didn&#039;t notice any change so I was increased to 100mg to deal with depression. It was horrendous and the first 6 weeks I suffered terrible nightmares and night sweats, became even more irate, anxious and upset and had suicidal thoughts. All advice outlets told me to continue for three months to see how I felt, only to find after 6 weeks I felt numb and emotionless, getting no pleasure or satisfaction from daily activities. This was not the medication for me and essentially made me feel worse."	6-Jul-17
128281	Phentermine	"I have been struggling with my weight for a few years now.  I was more and more depressed and my anxiety was through the roof with all the weight I was gaining.  My doctor offered me phentermine and because of all of the things I have heard about it I said no.  About 6 months went by and I was continuing to gain weight.  I finally gave in and decided to give it a try.  Thank goodness I decided to try it for myself and not listen to what I had heard.  I was very afraid to try it because I do have major anxiety.  I tired it on a Sunday when I didn&#039;t have to be at work.  It was such a great decision.  I have not experienced any of the side effects except my breath isn&#039;t the greatest.  I have been taking it for almost 2 months.  It has helped me lose weight"	15-Jan-16
63984	Sertraline	"Hi all been on this medication for over 4 weeks and have never felt so bad. Stomach aches and diarrhea. Sickness all day, dizziness, tight chest tired all day and sweating like crazy. Its been terrible. I can&#039;t take it anymore. I&#039;m on 50 mg for depression and anxiety. I just want to be happy and not stressed. I don&#039;t smoke or drink. I&#039;m a size 12. 44 year old lady"	19-Jun-17
142037	Escitalopram	"Lexapro is a good anti-depressant (I was perscribed this drug for anxiety but felt very positive after about two weeks). That being said, in my opinion it did more for my un-diagnosed depression then for my diagnosed anxiety, which is the reason for the perscription. I did rate this product a 9/10 though, because like I said it seems to be a great anti-depressant."	22-Nov-08
96816	Ambien	"I&#039;m a 19 year old female and I suffer from insomnia. I talked to my doctor about my horrid sleeping habits. I have a rough time falling asleep and when I do I only get about an hour of sleep. His first thought was to prescribe a 5mg dose of ambien. I was shocked as my knowledge of the drug was that it had a heavy impact and could cause you to not remember the night you took it. When I got home that night I got ready for bed, took the dose, and laid down. After an hour or so it finally kicked in but all it did was give me a sense of not being in the correct mindset. Just being a bit off. It didn&#039;t help me fall asleep whatsoever. In fact it caused me to remain alert and awake. My results were the complete opposite of its intended use."	1-Nov-16
97240	Ambien	"I have trouble staying asleep. I wake every night anywhere from between 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. and am up for the rest of the night. This medicine helped me sleep, but also made me very depressed.  It made me very angry and upset most of the time. I took this for about 3 months, until I got to the point that there was something very wrong with me and it was the medicine.  "	27-Jul-09
128909	Phentermine	"I have been on Phentermine for 66 days, take 37.5 mg/day, and lost 10 lbs. However as of tomorrow I will stop taking it. It has caused a very negative change in my thoughts &amp; personality &amp; causes huge mood swings. After being on it for 2 weeks I started noticing I was super sensitive, however blamed it on PMS at the time. It hasn&#039;t gotten better though. I have been irritable, angry, restless, &amp; just general feelings of sadness. The past couple days I also have been noticing &quot;flashes&quot; of something dark on the floor out of the corner of my eye but when I look in that direction nothing is there. When I read these are rare side effects I decided I need to stop taking it."	19-May-14
97120	Ambien	"I&#039;ve been using Ambien (10mg) for about 2 months and it works great. I suggest going straight to bed after taking it. Also, give yourself 7-8 hours of time to sleep. Ambien knocks me out in 15 minutes and I sleep about 9 hours. Feel great when I wake up. I can&#039;t turn my mind off when I go to bed so it has been a big help. I&#039;m 54 and this is the 1st medicine I&#039;ve taken on a regular basis so I was nervous about taking Ambien at first. It has been great."	22-Oct-11
127979	Phentermine	"Took my first dose this morning! I&#039;m feeling super good about phen. I&#039;m hoping to lose 60lbs. I&#039;m 5&#039;10 and 227lbs!"	18-Oct-16
96267	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been taking Zoloft 100mg for about 6 months now, it really has changed my life. Before medication, I wasn&#039;t leaving the house, had very little social contact and my anxiety was through the roof. Zoloft has been amazing for me, my mood has improved and I&#039;m getting out of the house and keeping in touch with friends and family. I still have my bad days and also feel groggy most mornings but other than that I&#039;ve had great results while taking Zoloft."	8-Apr-11

64563	Sertraline	"This med works for anxiety but....I have been on sooo many meds.  I need it more for anxiety than depression and that is why I chose Zoloft.  It does work for the anxiety only.  Problem after taking it for a couple years is my sleep is so disrupted, I clench my jaw so bad that when I wake up I have headaches, as well as my body.  I find myself all clenched up in a ball and then my body is sore from being tense, and feel foggy headed.  Newest problem is memory issues.  I guess it is this meds.  The sex was affected some... no weight gain.  Of course when you start any medicine, you have the normal, sweating, nauseous, dray mouth, but those things go away.  You have to give all medicines time to work!!!  I am going to wean off &amp; onto Cymbalta"	3-Mar-16
63923	Sertraline	"I developed a very specific form of OCD in my early 50&#039;s that is commonly described as &quot;Ear Worms&quot;.  It is where a song or a snippet of a song gets stuck in your head and keeps playing over and over.  It got so bad it was literally driving me insane.  I would have a snippet playing nonstop for WEEKS!  Day and night (kept me awake until I fell asleep from exhaustion).  Played at work CONSTANTLY where I couldn&#039;t focus.  I would be in meetings unable to pay attention because I would have a song blaring over and over in my head.  After ramping up doses, I settled at 100mg/day of Zoloft which has SAVED MY LIFE!  It works!  I can listen to music again and not yell at my wife when she sings.  And I have no side effects."	10-Jun-17
96355	Sertraline	"I took Zoloft as a teenager for depression and experienced paranoia and heard voices. As an adult, I tried Zoloft again for anxiety and depression as my doctor thought I had outgrown the previous side-effects. This time I felt an increase in anxiety, nervousness, and paranoia (which I did not experience on any other medicines). It did help lift the depression but it was not a calming medication and I would not recommend it for anxiety."	29-Jul-09
64473	Sertraline	"Sertraline changed my life. I used to be in a chronic state of anxiety and on the verge of panic in daily life. Sertraline made it easier to think rationally and manage anxiety. The only downside I have noticed is a minor dulling of emotions; my mental state is less volatile, but this applies to both positive and negative feelings.     I started at 50mg and increased to 75mg after 3 years."	24-Jul-16
72341	Tramadol	"Started taking Tramadol (50/mg) for a bulging disc that was discovered after an X-ray and MRI in 2011.  I didn&#039;t take 50 mg/day consistently until November. Tramadol worked extremely well for my back pain and elevated my mood quite a bit.  (Always a great thing for the husband and kids.)  I stopped taking it altogether 3 days ago because I&#039;m convinced it lowered my libido and it was making me gain a few pounds.  I&#039;m not a big person at 5&#039;2&quot; and 112lbs.  Someone had told me that it does aid in weight gain. The side effects of withdrawal are true and include (for me anyway): body aches, irritability, mood swings, sweating and dizziness. Unfortunately, my back pain has returned."	30-Jan-12
141299	Escitalopram	"Had 3 panic attacks in total..last one was big. So I went to the doctor, I was thinking I was having a stroke! After that experience I was very anxious! I could not learn or do anything! I was a mess for about a few weeks. So I my psychologist said I have Generalized anxiety disorder and of my passing of my father a few years ago and bullying in school lead to all this. I started with Lexapro and after 3 days I stopped it made me feel so sick and I had university exams coming up so I started it again  3 weeks ago and the strange thing is I have little side effects! First day I struggled with sleeping and I tend to feel tired in the morning and afternoon, But I hope that&#039;s goes away soon. Anxiety is much better. I&#039;m on 10mg. Waiting for my best results at 4-8 weeks!"	17-Dec-14
64013	Sertraline	"This medication saved my life I suffered with severe anxiety and panic attacks. I became really down because it had taken over my life and it was a daily struggle. After two days the medication stopped my panic attacks but also made me very tired and zombie like I didn&#039;t want to do much. However after about 2 weeks this stopped and I got better I improved each week. After a month I went back to work and now I am 6 months down the line and pretty much back to the old me anxiety free â¤ï¸ I know this medication effects everyone differently but for me it changed my life all for the better. Just give this medication a chance because it might be horrible at first but there is a light a the end of the tunnel guys. I hope this can give some faith."	10-May-17
96286	Sertraline	"This is great medicine to stop your depression. try ZOLOFT - regularly every day, for at least 1 month, you&#039;ll feel the actions. I promise."	11-Oct-10
96320	Sertraline	"I felt better on Zoloft but the symptom of diarrhea was too much because it wouldn&#039;t go away. I was on it for a whole month and for the last 3 weeks on it the diarrhea was unbearable. "	3-Jun-10
140981	Escitalopram	"I rate this medication very highly. I had no history of anxiety or depression before being struck down with severe generalised anxiety (and subsequently its bff, depression). I&#039;ve been on lexapro for 3 months now and my life is completely back to normal. If I still have side effects, they have normalised so that I no longer notice them. About a month ago I starting drinking wine again ( I got a reaction the first time, but was fine after that), and 3 weeks ago I started on coffee again (it made me hyperactive for the first week, then normalised). You just need to ease into it. Please don&#039;t give up on this med in the first week. It&#039;s a bit of a rough start but so worth it when you come through the other side."	22-Mar-16
119759	Ambien CR	"I just started using Ambien CR and like most of the people i was scared to take it because of all of these weird side effects that people experience but thank GOD it worked on me just fine. My doctor was gentle to me and she prescribed only 5mg and I must say it worked like a charm. I took it and half hour later (maybe even less) I was deep in sleep. I did sleep close to 5 hours and I must say I don&#039;t remember the last time I was feeling so refreshed and so rested. Other medicines I&#039;ve tried put me asleep but when I would wake up I would feel so groggy. I&#039;m finally happy to say that I found a medicine that works for me."	31-Mar-10
95816	Sertraline	"49 yo female with post traumatic stress disorder..severe anxiety, crazy obsessive compulsive thoughts...led to depression. Started at 50 mg, start ups were horrible increased anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder, night sweats, waking up in a panic when I could sleep, lethargic, feeling stoned and like a walking zombie....skin was hot and tingley shaking on the inside. Feeling flat and NO motivation to even brush my teeth. Went down to 25mg for a few days and now back to 50mg. On day 11 now and most of the depression has lifted. OCD isn&#039;t as bad, its more controllable, anxiety still there a bit. If this is the beginning of the future I&#039;m happy. It was worth the initial start! Can see the light at the end of this dark tunnel and I feel a bit free now."	29-Apr-14
141734	Escitalopram	"I was prescribed 10 mg a day for anxiety/panic attacks. I&#039;d never taken any sort of SSRI before. I took one pill and it scared me, I threw up several hours later and had the worst panic attack of my life. But I don&#039;t know if that was me, or the pill. So two weeks later, I chopped it in half and have taken 5mg everyday for the past 6 months. It has completely turned down the volume of anxiety and paranoia. I may never be able to go off of it. I have not had weight gain, anorgasmia, or decreased sex drive. I love it. I can live my life, it has taken that fog surrounding everything away. If you are super sensitive to medications like me, I encourage you to start with the lowest dose possible."	4-Jan-12
138722	Phentermine	"This is the best weight loss pill. I took it for three months and I lost 60 pounds. Its amazing, but we also have to understand that after taking them, we need to learn how to control our hunger, and make changes in our eating habits for life, because if we stop taking them and start eating bad for sure you are going to gain all the weight back  more. Good luck."	8-Jan-12
72269	Tramadol	"This medication has helped tremendously since I started taking it last week. Just the drowsiness is the downside, this medicine works better than Vicodin, Percocet, etc."	27-Apr-13
138611	Phentermine	"23 days ago, I started phentermine and went to the doctor today and lost a total of 18 pounds! WOW!! I was 243lbs and now 225lbs. In 30 days I expected to lose no more than 10 pounds! The real key here is if you are overweight like me. The first thing you need to do is start on a 1200 calorie diet with these pills. I count them with my fitness pal and you can just scan your foods you eat. I also up my calories by 200-300 calories on the weekends and don&#039;t take the pill on these days. If you only eat under the 1200 calories your body will go into starvation mode and the next time you eat anything bad, you will gain weight. You can drink diet pop and flavored water. I USUALLY eat breakfast, lunch, dinner and about a 200 calorie snack at night (usually chocolate fudge cake and ice cream). "	10-Jul-12
64616	Sertraline	"I was on this firstly for social anxiety disorder , after 1 month I felt pleased, happy and had interest in doing any thing then I concluded that I had mild depression but it has done nothing for my SAD,  but it helped by giving me the desire to socialize .. my ratings : 10 for depression and 6 for SAD"	7-Feb-16
71926	Tramadol	"Good experience. Got the med a long time ago. Some people react different to tramadol. It is heavy. But in my case far more effective than other medicines."	20-Nov-15
128699	Phentermine	"In one year, taking phentermine for three months on three months off, I lost 112 pounds! This was on the 37.5mg daily with some diet and exercise change after the first month. But in the first month with no change at all I lost 22 lbs. This medication changed my life."	28-Apr-15
127788	Phentermine	"I gained a lot of weight after having my 1st son and a failed IUD. My doc prescribed Adipex 37.5 and I took it 5-6 days per week for 5 months. In the beginning it gave me extreme dry mouth and it was hard to fall asleep because of the energy boost but it suppressed my appetite A LOT and if I ate to much it made me vomit.  I started working out slowly a few times per week and by the time I stopped taking it I was working out 5 days a week. I am 5&#039;8 and my start weight was 195 my end weight was 137.After my 2nd son I lost the weight easily and got back down to 140 but after my daughter I gained and could not lose anything, my energy was low and I could not control my appetite.  As soon. As I am done breastfeeding I will be taking Adipex again"	27-Feb-17
141438	Escitalopram	"Very effective for depression and obsessive thoughts. There is a side effect of drowsiness for the first few weeks, which gets better. I also take clonazepam for anxiety. This seems to be a much better treatment than the Cymbalta/Buspar combination I took a few years ago."	18-Dec-13
96958	Ambien	"I have been taking this drug for about 4 years.  Went in depression anxiety, and chronic insomnia.  I take 5 mg when I do take it and it works very well for me.  I have never experienced any of the horror stories that others have.  It immediately improved my mood, depression and anxiety as it finally allowed me to sleep.  I try not to take it more than 3 times a week to avoid dependency on it.  Sometimes I go weeks without it, sometimes 2 weeks straight on it due to situational anxiety."	24-Jan-16
71647	Tramadol	"I was on hydrocodone 10/325 through my pain management Dr, mind you it didn&#039;t take away my pain completely but it helped a lot. I was sent to a different pain Dr and he started me on tramadol 50 mgs every 8 hrs. The worst medication I have ever taken! Not only does it not do anything for the pain it has made me feel ill. Severe headaches and just an all around feeling of being unwell."	4-Sep-17
96501	Sertraline	"I am 55 years old and have been taking Zoloft over 20 years. For me it has been a miracle medicine. I find I am much more on an even keel and while some things still upset me, it&#039;s far less than without Zoloft. I find too I am much more rational in my thought processes and am more confident of choices I make. I have several medical conditions that contribute to feeling depressed, overwhelmed, and yes, even suicidal but since I began my therapy with Zoloft, I want to live. Without Zoloft, I did not.  I encourage anyone who feels depressed to seek help by finding the right medication for you. Life is hard enough without having to cope with feelings of severe negative emotions. I am so grateful for whoever created Zoloft."	18-Jan-09
97257	Ambien	"The drug actually only worked for about five hours but I did sleep soundly. However, the following day, after using Ambien, I experienced drowsiness, dizziness and stomach cramping."	26-Mar-09
95968	Sertraline	"I have been taking Zoloft for 10  years. I take 100 mg daily. I have found that all of my symptoms have diminished. In times real stress, I take an extra pill. All I can say is that none of the previous drugs I took helped me at all. I have depression and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. At age 59 I still react to anything that sounds like gunfire. I spent 33 years working for the government, 2 in the Army the rest in law enforcement. I have found that I have no issues to deal with. I did once while out of the country lose my prescription while backpacking. It was horrible for me and my two friends. I take my pill in the evening before bed. No side effects at all. I found Zoloft to be a God send for me."	26-May-13
97029	Ambien	"I think it&#039;s great. I&#039;ve been doing it for about 11 years, and it&#039;s one of the only medicine for insomnia that work for me."	18-May-14
128283	Phentermine	"I just started taking phentermine  as of 01/12/16 my weight is 191 and I am 29 yrs old. My goal is to loose 65 pds! Well for this 3 days so far I have a lot of energy and my cravings for food have dropped. I work in a sit down job all day and sometimes were slow and so I eat all day to keep me from boredom. I been working out for 30 mins because I actually have the energy to do it and watch what I eat. It is great to eat small amount and feel satisfied I have not been able to do this since I was a teenager. I definitely have dry mouth all day so I carry water with me everywhere and a little jittery at times but I feel it is worth it. I will post back in a month  to report my success."	14-Jan-16
64426	Sertraline	"I have been in a major depression for 3 years, and possibly a minor depression before that , I also have anxiety and social phobia,  I have been on Sertraline for almost two months now, and I noticed an enormous difference the first few days, I started to smile, laugh, make eye contact, and the fear of public is slowly easing !   I can not describe how bad life was before Sertraline.  I am 34 years old and have been living a life that wasn&#039;t a life at all, now I am feeling better than I have ever felt.  I do get dry mouth !  But, oh to laugh again!  (Worth it). I am usually not a person who even uses Tylenol ,  so for me to try this, I was desperate .  I don&#039;t feel high nor drugged or even out of my body!  I feel whole"	27-Jun-16
71660	Tramadol	"Not at all able to hold chronic pain back, at all. An ER Dr said who ever prescribed it was wrong because it does not help, at all, for Sickle Cell Disease."	6-Aug-17
34115	Tramadol	"I have used Tramadol for over 5 years. I am on a 200mg slow release tablet of which I take 3-5 a day. They say that it decreases the heart rate but it seems to me that last night when I checked my heart was doing 190/min....so that blows that theory out of the water. I can tell that it does make you restless and at times reckless and also increase your anger responses. Hope this helps."	26-Aug-09
142035	Escitalopram	"I guess Im one of the few who didn&#039;t see a difference in my depression while taking Lexapro. It did wonders for my anxiety attacks, but my depression never went away. Also, if you start taking Lexapro, please consult your doctor if you plan or need to stop for any reason. The withdrawal can be a little harsh."	30-Nov-08
96437	Sertraline	"This drug has been so helpful to me. I no longer have bad anxiety. My temper has been even, and overall I&#039;m much happier. I take one 50mg pill per day. This has decreased my sex drive a little bit. I also find myself to be warm or sweating more. The pros definitely outweigh the cons of this drug."	12-Jul-09
139278	Phentermine	"Well I&#039;ve been trying to lose weight since I gave birth to my son 14 yrs ago. And my new years resolution was to lose weight, and I was give Adipex by my doctor. I started on my diet Jan.2008. I weighed 210 lbs. And now with eating healthly and exercise I weigh about 180 lbs. I lost 30 pounds and I&#039;m very happy with myself and thankful for my family and friends with all their support."	1-May-08
72295	Tramadol	"Seems to be the only thing that helps since Bextra was taken off the market."	21-Dec-12
78436	Allegra	"Allegra is too expensive and doesn&#039;t do anything for me. Not worth it."	10-Aug-16
142001	Escitalopram	"I have always had anxiety, but after having my twins at 25 weeks the anxiety just got worst. After their long stay in the NICU and they were fine I thought things would get better but it became my everyday life. I have now been on Lexapro for 4 days and I am very excited of the effects already. I feel more relaxed and I don&#039;t get upset over the little things. I am actually losing weight and sleeping better. I wish I had gone to my MD sooner because I feel like I am on my way to being my old self again. I am now on my way to being a better mom and wife and that makes me feel great."	4-Jun-09
138506	Phentermine	"I am a female  with hypothyroidism, post menopause and over 50.  I was at the heaviest in my life gaining over 60 lbs after being diagnosed with my thyroid disorder. I finally found a Dr. who would put me on Phentermine. I have been on it for a week short of 90 days and I&#039;ve lost 32 lbs. There&#039;s nothing that in my 7 yrs fighting this hypothyroidism that allowed me to lose even 10 lbs. Not even cutting my daily caloric intake to less than 1200 calories a day. Which my Dr. wasn&#039;t at all happy about since she says 1400-1600 is the very least someone should eat.  I am so very happy with the results. I wish of course I could have lost the entire 60lbs I gained when I got the slow thyroid issue. But I am nevertheless very pleased."	15-Jun-13
140477	Escitalopram	"This medication is possibly good for thousands of patients but gave me agitation and hot feet after  using only for only  3 days . These symptoms might happened to others as any medicine probably cause reaction to any individual."	11-May-17
34201	Tramadol	"I didn&#039;t know anything about this drug and was on darvocet when my workmans company suggested I switch to this. It was a little weak at first but then I got it into my system on a regular basis and it seemed to dull my pain. Both heels were crushed in a fall and I had reconstruction surgery. This does make me sleepy and is terrible to get off of. I had every symptom of withdrawal listed. I had to call my doctor back and be put back onto it. BEWARE."	23-Mar-09
72283	Tramadol	"Great for Post traumatic stress disorder symptoms."	21-Feb-13
140672	Escitalopram	"I started taking this medication, and it has literally been a godsend. I was having anger issues, outbursts, anxiety, and ultimately depression. This drug killed all of it. I feel so much happier, stronger, and back go the person I was well over 10 years ago.    I had once where anger got the best of me, and I slapped my hand hard against the wall. But other than that, everything has been great. Don&#039;t let other reviews scare you from taking this drug. It affects everyone differently. If it&#039;s making you more anxious or depressed, it&#039;s most likely not the right drug for you.    Side effects I had were headache the first day, major fatigue the second day, and diarrhea. I&#039;ll probably experience a bit more as my body adjusts, but it&#039;s SO worth it."	26-Sep-16
141445	Escitalopram	"Lexapro (Cipralex in Canada) is an effective antidepressant that worked well for generalized anxiety disorder. I took it because I had general anxiety (occasional panic attacks) and depression. It worked well in both areas. It helped a lot with mood, confidence, anxiety, motivation. But it was not without side effects. It does cause weight gain, although the exact reason is confusing. I went from 180 pounds to 200 pounds in 6 months. There are also sexual side effects, prolonged ejaculation with very little feeling and a strange feeling of being unable to urinate freely (taking longer than usual). It made me very sleepy. Weening off is difficult. Those are the pros and cons. If the cons don&#039;t sound too bad to you it will help otherwise."	11-Jun-14
71688	Tramadol	"I have treatment resistant Major Depression and as a result, I&#039;ve taken so many drugs over the years that I can&#039;t list them all. I got kidney stones a while back and got tramadol to help me with the pain. It didn&#039;t help much for that, but it sure helped treat my depression. I talked with my primary care doctor about this and she&#039;s reluctant to prescribe it if it isn&#039;t for pain. As the result, I&#039;m going to find a new doctor... One who knows a bit more about psychiatry."	9-Jun-17
72095	Tramadol	"After hurting my back, hips and developing sciatica from lifting people in hospitals/nursing homes/rehab/homecare, I was given Ultram for the excruciating pain.  It worked wonderfully without the dopiness associated with narcotics.  I had also suffered from depression since I was a child and had been through numerous meds that didn&#039;t work, or made my life even worse.  Tramadol is the only med that I have taken that has successfully treated both my chronic pain as well as my depression, allowing the sun to shine in my life."	18-Dec-14
95949	Sertraline	"After 1 week of taking Zoloft, I became depressed and had uncontrollable suicidal ideation. Never experienced anything like it. Went to ER 3 times in 2 days to protect myself. I couldn&#039;t shake the horrible urge until about 3-4 days off the medicine. I told my psych on the 4th day and she said that sometimes happens to people under 25?"	23-Jul-13
96615	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been on Zoloft 50mg for over two years. I am a more relaxed and easy-going person because of Zoloft.  Prior to starting the medicine, I was anxious all the time, worried constantly about everything, and suffered periods of depression and hopelessness.  Now I am a better wife, friend, and person in general."	5-Aug-08
138634	Phentermine	"I have been taking phentermine for a 2 weeks and have lost 12 pounds. From 213 to 201. It has significantly decreased my appetite. In terms of energy boost, I experienced it for the first few days and it has since worn off. I am overall happy with my progress so far..   "	13-Apr-12
139000	Phentermine	"I have been taking Phentermine only for 3 days now.  The first day I took the medication I had some dizziness. After the first day some dry mouth and very little loss of appetite. I do drink about a gallon of water per/day sometimes more and my workouts are excellent &quot;I like to sweat profusely when working out&quot; with this pill I see a good workout. I don&#039;t know how much I&#039;ve lost because I only like to weigh myself every two weeks. When I started I weighed 208lbs. My goal weight is 180 lbs, but the Doctor says she would like me to loose at least 40 lbs. I can&#039;t wait to see the weight start falling off. I&#039;m having some slight doubts about this pill. I still crave some sweets but not much. And I do sleep very good. "	16-Jul-09
63990	Sertraline	"I have been on sertraline for 2 months. I find I&#039;m always tired sleep more than I am awake...have no energy feel totally drained it&#039;s difficult when you have to work..and I still have terrible heads..."	15-Jun-17
95984	Sertraline	"I am a vet with post traumatic stress disorder. My dr. Just put me on 25mg sertraline. My first night of taking the pill I could not sleep. I&#039;ll have to wait and see any other effects."	9-Apr-13
139065	Phentermine	"This medicine will work. I have 4 children and needed to take off the pounds, which very hard to do when working and caring for your family. This medicine helped me in many ways but a controlled and well balanced diet and light exercise is key to keeping the weight off. Moderations/motivation is best and an old picture to remind you of what lerks around the corner."	27-May-09
128109	Phentermine	"Update***    Started Phentermine Feb 22, 2016 at 269lbs. Last update on here was April 25th, at 247lbs. Since then I started weight watchers, which has been beneficial in keeping me on track as far as the types of foods I take in. I weighed 6/10 and I was 235. The weight loss is slow, but I still find phentemine very helpful in suppressing my appetite. A little over 30lbs in about 3.5 mos."	13-Jun-16
138682	Phentermine	"Well so far I been on this for 5 days and it gives me energy.  I been on the low Carb diet for about 5 weeks so I hope this medicine works.  And I found out if you drink a lot of whiskey while on this you will have major problem. Well I go back to the doctor in like 9 days so I hope to see some weight loss."	5-Dec-11
141533	Escitalopram	"I have been taking this medication for a little over a year now and it seems to be working like a charm! I am currently 19 years old and the reason I started this medication was because I was experiencing a lot of anxiety and depression coming out of high school. I have had some recent life changing experiences that have ultimately given me a sense of hopelessness but the medication seemed to calm me down and removed the hopeless feelings. My doctor started me on the 10 mg and I have not yet needed to lower or increase my dosage. The only real side effects that I have experienced were occasional headaches and fatigue. When taking this medication it is very important to not miss a dose as well. I would ultimately recommend this medication."	16-Sep-13
34225	Tramadol	"I was prescribed Tramadol for lower back pain.  I knew that Vicodin worked for me and was weary at first.  It is a great substitute. It just cuts through the pain and lets you function normally."	6-Feb-09
141394	Escitalopram	"I was very depressed after my divorce 11 years ago. I would cry easily everyday. My doctor put me on Lexapro 20 mg a day. After a few weeks I was calm and able to handle the difficulties that I had to face. I have never stopped taking it but have cut back to 10mg per day. Each time I try to ween off Lexapro I get very emotional again. My only negative effect has been weight gain. Not happy about the weight gain, but it beats crying at the drop of a hat."	25-Aug-14
71595	Tramadol	"This medication works well for me. I do construction lifting and so on."	14-Jul-17
96365	Sertraline	"I starting taking Zoloft 8 weeks ago. I was extremely stressed out and was suffering from PTSD due to a bad car accident. After about 1 1/2 wks I really noticed a difference. Not stressed anymore but I do feel a bit Zombie like. I also have a problem with memory and focusing. Also really tired at night. Overall right now I guess it is worth the trade off. Also have intestinal issues but hope it will go away."	9-Mar-10
72071	Tramadol	"I suffer chronic anxiety, negative thoughts and daily panic attacks. Have taken Xanax, Klonopin, Valium and Ativan. I can&#039;t believe it but Tramadol actually works better for anxiety than all these benzos put together. I haven&#039;t taken my daily 4mg of klonopin but am feeling fantastic and very chilled on Tramadol. They should approve this stuff for both Anxiety and Depression, it&#039;s incredible."	8-Apr-15
71809	Tramadol	"Diagnosed with double hernia this weekend. Considerable pain. This is the first time I&#039;ve taken Tramadol. Pain went from a &quot;9&quot; to a &quot;2&quot;. Also I  feel better mentally and had a very good nites sleep."	29-Aug-16
127903	Phentermine	"53 year old female, 5&#039;6, 202 lbs. Lost 30+ lbs in 9 months by eating all &quot;fresh&quot; food (nothing from a package) and walked 10 mins 2x a day (bought a cheap bracelet pedometer that kept me motivated.) Got down to 186. Back up to 202. Asked my Dr if I could try this. Want to get to 170. Started today at 5 am! :) Will keep you posted!  Thank you all so much for sharing your stories...it is very comforting to have so many in the same boat! :)"	2-Nov-16
140911	Escitalopram	"I went to my OB GYN to ask about Lexapro for some major depression &amp; anxiety I was experiencing. Lexapro had worked quite well for a friend of mine. I had previously taken Zoloft a few years prior &amp; it made my post-partum depression worse.  I had great hopes for this drug, but it unfortunately did NOT work well for me. I felt like a zombie. I believe it gave me psychosis. I also experienced my first panic attack after being on 10 MG for 3 days. I then took 5 MG for two more days and stopped taking it all together.  Still 3 months after stopping I am having panic attacks with some psychotic features. I&#039;ve pulled myself out of that deep depression though. Still have bad days occasionally, but I&#039;m only taking Xanax as needed."	4-Jan-16
214694	Escitalopram	"I have been on a low dose of generic Lexapro for almost a month now, 5 mg, and it has drastically improved my quality of life. I was suffering from anxiety and mild depression due to other significant health problems that weren&#039;t getting better--the more I worried about my health the worse it got, and it kept going in a circle on and on. The first week of taking the medicine it caused a slight headache off and on, and some mild dizziness and constipation. But those side effects went away completely by week 2. Now I&#039;m getting back to normal, I&#039;m the happiest I&#039;ve been in 2 years, I feel like myself again.   I was scared to try another anxiety medicine after a bad experience with Zoloft. But the lexapro has been wonderful! Don&#039;t lose hope!"	27-Sep-17
141198	Escitalopram	"I found Lexapro to be only slightly effective for Seasonal Affective Disorder and mild depression. It worked better for anxiety. I was able to sleep on this medication. It exacerbated my tinnitus, but otherwise there were no noteworthy side effects."	29-Apr-15
128770	Phentermine	"My knees hurt to walk, my feet hurt to stand...I couldn&#039;t take it anymore....I went to doc and weighed in at 287.8...3 days later and I am already down 7.8 lbs.  No exercise yet but will when get in the 260&#039;s.  I feel better already and can&#039;t wait to loose another 60."	22-Feb-15
140480	Escitalopram	"I am not one to normally leave a review but in this case I felt the need.  I have suffered from generalised anxiety for years. It had gotten increasingly worse over the last year and I finally got up the courage to talk about it to the doctor. (Ironically the thought was enough to give me anxiety) The doctor started me off at the smaller dose of 10mg, which helped a lot however I would still have bursts of anxiety so they decided to increase it to 20mg and what can I say.. what a miracle drug! If anyone is suffering from anxiety to the point where it is affecting their day to day life please try this medication. It may not work for everyone but I thank my lucky stars I decided to try it as my life has changed completely.."	8-May-17
141427	Escitalopram	"I have suffered with anxiety and agoraphobia since I was 6. Since the age of 19, I never went more than 45 mins from home. I started on Lexapro and an anti-anxiety medicine in 2009. I have made it to a beach that I hadn&#039;t seen since I was 14, I am now 60, and have been 7 times since 2009. The drive is 1 hr 30 mins from home. I go every summer, more than once, and sometimes stay a few days, one time staying 6 days! This medicine is a God send, I wish they had it 20 years ago."	26-Jan-14
72489	Tramadol	"I use ultram 50mg and it has helped with my nerve pain due to my neck and back"	26-May-11
72569	Tramadol	"I have been taking Ultram (200 mg a day) for several years now.  I found that it does take the top of the pain down but doesn&#039;t give me great relief.  I am finding it&#039;s effectiveness less and less and will be trying to wean off of it but withdrawal symptoms are pretty bad.  Please be well aware of the dependency issue. "	21-Jan-10
138683	Phentermine	"I have been on and off phentermine since 2009, and I always have great results. I have a terrible binge eating condition and unbearable sugar cravings. Phentermine completely changed my cravings to salads and unsweetened foods. I also have insomnia from hunger and digestion problems. I sleep like a baby on the medication and I find that reading and focusing are much easier. I got the best results working out on an empty stomach and then taking 1/2 pill, then breakfast, then 1/2 pill or whole pill in the evening. Again, I sleep better on it. I did develop a slight tolerance after the first year, but taking a break really helped me get the full benefit of the medication and refocus on my diet. The side effects are minimal."	4-Dec-11
138794	Phentermine	"I started using Adipex-P December 14th 2010 so its been 2 months. First month I lost 12 lbs second month I lost only 2 pounds. It is very disappointing to only loose 2 pounds in the second month but I guess it is better than nothing. I started out weighting 164 lbs now I weight 150lbs. Total weight loss of 14 lbs. I am 5&quot;4&quot;, I have a thyroid condition which makes it very hard for me to lose weight. This is my last month for the medication and from what I read here I have to be careful and not go cold turkey off the medication so I don&#039;t gain the weight back. I started taking half a pill instead of whole pill and I wont take the pills on the weekends. I want to go down to 135lbs."	12-Feb-11
141691	Escitalopram	"It helped my depression tremendously, but lost its effectiveness within 5 years."	28-Nov-12
128554	Phentermine	"This is another update... I started taking the medicine on 6/23. I was 301 pounds. Today, 7/3, I am 287! 14 pounds in 10 days- not too shabby :) I noticed that I haven&#039;t lost any weight in the past 2 days, so I&#039;m going to play with my diet some. Also, I&#039;ve noticed that if I take the medicine before 11am, I&#039;m STARVING by bedtime. I now take it between 11-11:30 and it keeps me feeling full throughout the day. I only eat one small meal after this. I will update again next week with my progress!"	3-Jul-15
139160	Phentermine	"I started using Adipex on March 31.  Today is April 2nd.  I used to drink at LEAST 2 cups of coffee a day.  I haven&#039;t thought about or needed coffee at all since I&#039;ve been taking Adipex. I was a chronic pusher-of-the-snooze-button 20 times every morning.  Now, I wake up feeling refreshed and energized.  The dry mouth?  I personally think it&#039;s the best part.  I&#039;m drinking a liter of water a day.  I don&#039;t think I drank a liter of water the entire year of 2008.  I haven&#039;t weighed myself yet. I&#039;m trying to hold off as long as possible but I can say that my face has gotten a lot thinner.  So if I haven&#039;t lost any weight I know its coming."	2-Apr-09
128377	Phentermine	"I&#039;ve been on phentermine 30mg for 9 weeks and have lost only 6.2#.  That averages out to less than 3/4# weight loss per week.  I went to my doctor today to report how it was working and we decided to crank it up to the 37mg dosage.  Only time will tell how that works but I&#039;m quite disappointed in the results.  I was hoping for much better results.  :("	3-Nov-15
141086	Escitalopram	"Hi. I am on day 16 of 10mg. The first 6 days I was very tired, excessively. But the majority of my anxiety was gone by then.  Days 6-8 I had severe insomnia, it passed and by day 9 I had no racing thoughts before going to slep. Today is day 16. I feel better about my life circumstances. I have a 9 year old with Aspergers. I am no longer spending every waking moment obsessing over what will become of his future. My cognitve functioning seems clearer.  Have been able to keep up more with home chores. Still not as energised as I would like to be. Coffee makes me more jittery since starting the meds. I can now tell the differnce between caffeine jitters and my real anxiety though.  I am hoping that by week 6-8 I have even more clarity."	21-Oct-15
71593	Tramadol	"I was put on tramadol 100mg SR about 9 months ago for a very painful hip bursa and thin tendons. I was too afraid to get a cortisone injection. It made me feel strange at first and bad headaches. I already suffer depression and it seemed to help me out there as well as soothing my pain. I had no idea it was addictive. I have read so many horror stories about this drug that I don&#039;t want it anymore. I&#039;m now taking myself off it slowly. I was only taking one tablet each morning and sometimes one at night if the pain was bad. I&#039;ve started taking one every other day and my lord even that is so noticeable. Now I&#039;m in  pain and also very highly strung, I&#039;m going to build it so I can go more days without it until I&#039;m off it. Please think very hard before taking."	17-Jul-17
97028	Ambien	"I&#039;m 19 and suffer from bad insomnia. I&#039;ve tried Benadryl, Unisom, even a different prescription sleeping pill, Restoril (temazepam). These all either didn&#039;t work or left me extremely groggy in the morning and throughout the day. Anyway, I was scheduled to study abroad and my worst fear the entire trip was not sleeping in a foreign atmosphere. My Dr. prescribed me a few weeks worth of Ambien 10 MG. I can&#039;t tell you how great this medication was. It drifted me off to a gentle, deep sleep and I stayed asleep for at least 7 hours. I woke up happy and refreshed In the morning; even energized! I took the high dose and did not experience any side effects or hallucinations. I was able to enjoy my trip."	2-Jun-14
141590	Escitalopram	"Hey Everyone! I am going to try and make my story short. I am 26 years old and did not know what anxiety or an anxiety attack was until I turned 25.  I was driving to lunch one day and for no reason at all it hit me. I felt as if I wasn&#039;t in control of my own body. I felt like I was going to pass out at the wheel, my heart began to race and my arms and legs went numb. I drove myself straight to the ER. The doc told me it was an anxiety attack. After that first attack I could not leave my house for two weeks in fear that I would pass out or lose control. I was then put on Lexapro, the first two weeks I felt the side affects..AFTER THAT A true BLESSING!! NO ANXIETY OR ATTACKS IN 2 WEEKS! I FEEL LIKE ME AGAIN!"	29-Mar-13
138995	Phentermine	"Out of desperation I tried this medication - not really believing that it would work.  Much to my amazement it did work.  I have, by the grace of God, lost 60 pounds and am able to wear my old clothes.  I feel great and am healthier than I ever. My cholesterol level and blood pressure are under control and I have gone from wearing a size 14 to a size 4!  "	28-Aug-09
140646	Escitalopram	"My anxiety hit a high in my mid 20s &amp; went from every once in a while to a constant drowning feeling of anxiety. When it became paralyzing, I started therapy. After 3 months of therapy &amp; being against medication, I started to learn more about the illness, how it runs in my family &amp; because the physical symptoms weren&#039;t going away I started Lexapro. For the 1st couple of months as I increased the mg, I became paranoid that I was going to become suicidal. I had never thought about this in my life, never depressed &amp; was actually very happy with my life. I was just so paranoid that I would lose control of my anxiety and hurt myself. It went away and I feel better than ever. I see life differently, more grateful for every day "	22-Apr-17
128096	Phentermine	"I wrote a review before when I was a couple weeks into taking phentermine. I am 5&#039;4&quot; and I started on May 1st, 2016 weighing in athe 236 pounds. I was postpartum 1 year after my second child. Today is July 10th, 2016 and I weigh 200 pounds and still losing by the day! I&#039;ve noticed lots of changes I&#039;m going to share with you all. For starters, I did experience the dry mouth side effect for the first month. I also experienced lots of energy which was a huge thing for me. Now that I&#039;m about 2 1/2 months in and the energy really subsided. Also, in my second month there were days I would not take my medicine because I honestly just missed eating. I also noticed I could continue healthy choices w/o the med. I&#039;ll check back in!"	10-Jul-16
138580	Phentermine	"I did not think that a pill could help speed along the process of weight loss so much. I have had 4 children and am now 37. losing that weight was not easy like it was when I was younger. My last child was born a year ago and I only lost 10 of the 30 lbs I gained. I am 5&#039;8 and weighed 222 the day I was prescribed Phentermine (January 11, 2013. As of March 7, I weigh 198). 24 lbs in less that 2 months I am HAPPPPPPYYYY! My goal is to be 150lbs. Looks like I will be there soon enough. I drink a lot of water because the only side effect I have is extremely dry mouth. The first night I took it I did have trouble sleeping but not since the first night. I go in to my Dr once a month for a check up, weigh in and new prescription. I highly recommend it!"	7-Mar-13

141933	Escitalopram	"I have been taking Lexapro for about 5 years now after 2 fairly major &quot;breakdowns&quot;. It has been an absolute Godsend for me. At one point the doctor thought I could come off it but I fairly quickly found my feelings dropping again and went back on it. Now I take 5mg a day and I am fine."	30-Nov-09
63856	Sertraline	"Since my twenties I would have anxiety from time to time. In 2003 my mother passed away and my anxiety came on to the extent that I thought about suicide. My Dr put me on Sertraline,  a packet to start 12.5mg, 25mg, and then 50mg. While the first 2 or 3 weeks I still had some anxiety, and for maybe a month or so my emotions were flat, eventually I felt normal again. I can even drive on the interstate without fear after years of struggle. I have been on Sertraline for 14 years now, and although I still have some issues with sleep, I feel normal most of the time. It takes a few weeks for your body to adjust, so hang in there if you can."	30-Aug-17
128463	Phentermine	"I&#039;m 28 with two kids I just started adipex and I love it all ready. I am  waiting to see results. I work til midnight and stay very busy. I&#039;m 224 and can&#039;t wait untilIi see how many pounds I lose. I would like to get down to about 170 thats my goal."	24-Sep-15

34248	Tramadol	"For a severely abscessed tooth this pain killer worked great. The side effects were sweats, nagging headache, and constipation."	25-Nov-08
64743	Sertraline	"Zoloft works for me. No side affects. Just brought me back to feeling normal.  I take 100MG a day. This was a life and marriage saver for me. I was so panic-depressed-angry before."	20-Sep-15
72110	Tramadol	"Following 4 years of neck pain my neurologist finally prescribed tramadol, pain relief is so nice. I can enjoy my life again."	18-Oct-14
72184	Tramadol	"TEARS of joy! OMG! Thank you all!! I started Tramadol after my back surgery, I begged my Dr. to get me off hydrocodone after 20 years, no more nonnarcotics, this was for personal reasons, I enjoy sitting in my chair every day watching TV, I THOUGHT I was as good as it gets!! I accepted life as that, but... all of a sudden, I found myself off the chair cleaning, doing things, happy, doing wonderful, not enough of pain control, I experimented with doses, after 3 months I made a mistake and ran out 5 days early, OMG! This is how I realized that the Tramadol is what made me a person again, and your comments made it SO! I am 58 yrs. woman, disabled, takes 100 mg Zoloft everyday, now I am alive!"	10-Jul-14
138517	Phentermine	"Lost 16 pounds in 4 weeks! Love this. Learning to change my way of thinking as it is related to food. People learn to eat healthy, get moving, and eat smaller portions of food. If you don&#039;t, the weight will return when you stop taking the pill."	31-May-13
95803	Sertraline	"Diarrhea, uncontrollable muscle spasms, severe panic attacks, severe anxiety, severe restlessness, sweating, and bruising is all this medication did to me."	19-Jan-14
97273	Ambien	"I have been taking Ambien for over 2 years now and other than doing things and not remembering about doing it later I love it. But it&#039;s not for everyone. My hubby can take it and be out for 2 days straight so be careful."	19-Dec-08
139094	Phentermine	"I started phentermine on February 13th. I started at 230lbs and now weigh 204lbs. This pill is a miracle for me. I&#039;ve had six children and the last was a c-section and at 28yrs old I just couldn&#039;t lose the weight. My goal is to get to 150lbs, what I weighed before all the children. A note to everyone the pill won&#039;t do it all by itself. At some point you will need to exercise and start watching what you eat. After the first day I&#039;ve had no side effects except for dry mouth."	2-Mar-09
72266	Tramadol	"I&#039;ve suffered from depression spells, and mood disorders, but have had CHRONIC anxiety/panic attacks my whole life. I&#039;ve taken a benzodiazepine for countless years, which worked well for some of these things but not all. Over the years I tried many different supplement meds typically prescribed for these issues, but none worked or they had horrible side effects on me. So my doctor suggested Tramadol--I asked how this could even work (a pain medicine)? He explained its an off-label use of the medication but has found it very successful in other similar psychiatric patients and how he researched and explained how it chemically works in the brain (which I didn&#039;t really understand)...but IT WORKS AMAZINGLY! I finally live a NORMAL and HAPPY life!"	20-May-13
140743	Escitalopram	"I have suffered with depression and anxiety for most of my life. One of my best friends convinced me to talk with my doctor about an antidepressant. I tried several different medications. Finally, I was prescribed Wellbutrin 100 mg., which worked pretty well for several years. However, it stopped working so my doctor increased the dosage to 150 mg. Bad idea. I had a seizure and was hospitalized for two days. After this experience, I decided to not take anything. Another bad idea. The depression got so bad, I could hardly function. I went to a new doctor and he prescribed me Lexapro. What a miracle drug. It took sometime to get use to the medicine but once my body adjusted, I started feeling great. I don&#039;t recall ever feeling so happy as now"	24-Jul-16
34156	Tramadol	"Takes about 45 minutes to an hour for the effects to set in. Works significantly better when taking the tramadol with an over the counter pain reliever like Advil or Aleve. Do not take on an empty stomach, as it can cause nausea."	12-Jun-09
72473	Tramadol	"I take this pill for back pain. I have bulging and degenerative disks, I am 30 yo female. I have been on this medication for about 5 years or so give or take a few months and it works great. When I have the medication in my system I feel no pain what so ever, however, I must warn new patients who are just starting this medication. Try not to up the dose to much because the withdraw is horrible. When you are running low and you know you can&#039;t get none right away its best too ween yourself off as much as possible. "	19-Oct-11
140907	Escitalopram	"I have been on Lexapro 5mg (yes that&#039;s it) for over 3 months now and I&#039;m ready to throw in the towel. First, let me say my anxiety has been greatly reduced. But at what cost? I am a zombie-I have no motivation to do anything and I&#039;m always in a foggy state. My performance at work has greatly suffered, along with my cognitive ability. Social anxiety has gotten worse only because I&#039;m a recluse - just too tired and unmotivated to interact with people! Frequent and strong anhedonia. I wouldn&#039;t advise you not to try lexapro- it is well regarded and often effective. But be cautious as doctors don&#039;t get that there are side effects to this besides sexual ones. I felt the same after one week as I do now but I was continually told it would go away"	10-Jan-16
141739	Escitalopram	"I started taking 40mg Lexapro daily about 6 years ago after several suicide attempts. It must be working because I&#039;m still here but I still struggle with anxiety though it is more manageable with the Lexapro than without it."	14-Dec-11
72048	Tramadol	"I&#039;ve experienced Restless Legs on and off since I was a child. I remember my legs aching very badly and feeling like I constantly had to shake and move them around. This used to only happen when I was extremely tired. But over the years it has gotten worse. My doctor started me off on a low dose of Tramadol (50mg 2x a day). 50mg didn&#039;t really help so now I take 100mg anywhere from 2-4 times a day and it completely gets rid of my restless legs. I can sleep for more than 2 hours and I can actually get comfortable, fall asleep and stay asleep. I would rather use this medication the rest of my life (I am 35) than ever have to deal with restless legs again."	19-May-15
141031	Escitalopram	"At age 59 I had my first panic attack along with anxiety that would last all day and into the evening. I was given Prozac which I believe caused the symptoms to occur. After just one week on Lexapro 20 mg my anxiety completely disappeared and I haven&#039;t had a panic attack since. I would highly recommend Lexapro for anyone suffering from depression and anxiety couples together. I don&#039;t walk in fear now I&#039;m completely relaxed and confident! Thank God for this medication!"	19-Nov-15
139156	Phentermine	"This product was awesome. I went from 192 lbs in September of 2005 to 138lbs in January of 2006 without any form of exercise.  I was working 2 jobs and it gave me more energy than anything else I&#039;ve ever tried. Some days I would have to force myself to eat something because I just wasn&#039;t hungry.  Then, they took the stuff of the market (in Canada at least).  Neither I nor my doctor can get it anywhere.  I didn&#039;t have ANY side effects other than losing ugly fat.    Bring this stuff back!  I know plenty of people who tried this and ALL loved it with great results.  Since being off Ionamin, I&#039;m back at 174 lbs.  There is nothing on the market like Ionamin. Please bring it back."	10-Apr-09
96023	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been taking Zoloft for 3 days on a doctors recommendation and don`t notice any of the the benefits yet. I have felt a whole bunch of side effects including nausea, loss of appetite, drowsiness and diarrhea. I&#039;ll be seeing the doctor in two days and from what I understand these side effects should decrease over time. "	7-Oct-12
139217	Phentermine	"I started taking Adipex 3/6/08, I was 182 lbs. By 6/3/08, I was down to 152 lbs. 30 lb loss is great. I have 7 lbs to go.  The program is great, if you follow your diet plan and stay hydrated. 200cal.for breakfast at 7am, 350cal. lunch at 12pm, and 450cal. for dinner at 6pm absolutely no  snacking in between. My only problem was constipation. Suddenly ceasing the medicine may cause side effects.  Overall I love Adipex. Love it, Love it, Love it!"	10-Jun-08
64423	Sertraline	"Before taking this medication I was experiencing sleepless nights. Sometimes this would happen for 3 nights in a row. There was no reason for me to feel anxiety or feel as if a panic attack was coming on. My panic and anxiety feelings were in my stomach&amp; my throat. I felt like I could scream but I could never get it loud enough. I was also experiencing stomach ulcer symptoms.  I had no clue what was wrong w/ me. At work I started to experience social anxiety.  I would feel panicked, my face would get flushed &amp; my neck and chest would break out in hives. One other extremely annoying symptom was getting up during the night to pee when I really  didn&#039;t have to. My doctor prescribed 25 then 50 then 75 then 100mg of zoloft and I&#039;m 100% better."	3-Jul-16
128258	Phentermine	"245 to 195 from July 03, 2015 to December 25, 2015. I was prescribed Phentermine 37.5mg as a weight loss supplement and used this in conjunction with My Fitness Pal Calorie Counter and very irregular exercise, haha. I noticed an increase in energy and most of my cravings disappeared. My only side effect was cotton-mouth, but only if I didn&#039;t drink enough water. Goal is 140 and I will get there. Husband was so impressed that he started in Sept and went from 198 to 174 in just over a month! I am so grateful for this medication and am getting ready to start again!"	2-Feb-16
140628	Escitalopram	"Like many others I suffer from general anxiety on and off for 10 year and this past winter it got the best of me to the point that I couldn&#039;t function. I used xanax 0.5 up to 3 times per day for that episode but that is not the long term solution that I wanted. So I was put on escitalopram 10mg and holy crap it gave me my life back. The first 3 weeks were tough with the nausea, sweating, insomnia, mood swings. BUT if you can stick it out the 3-5th week I noticed a gradual and significant improvement in mood and ability to control thought.Since Week 5 I have been what I consider totally normal for the past 7 months.  I encourage anyone going through this to hang in there it will get better. Listen to your doctors."	13-Dec-16
64540	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been on Sertraline since march 8, I experienced horrible side effects including severe panic attacks and chronic anxiety the first couple of weeks. Right now it seem&#039;s to have stabilised my mood and functioning. I&#039;m no longer lying and bed and feeling like i&#039;m dying lol.  I&#039;m going to continue taking this medication :-)."	26-Mar-16
140601	Escitalopram	"I have been taking lexapro for about six months now.  I was put on it for a panic attack and mild depression.  I am someone who never takes meds unless I have too and was very worried about being on this drug because I feared the side affects when it would be time to get off. I decided on therapy and lexapro.  I am only on ten milagrams, 39 and petite.  I can&#039;t say that this drug has caused me weight gain but if I am extra hungry I choose a healthier snack.  I will say that the first few days of taking the med I did feel tired,  and tense in my arms but I will say the panic attack attributed to that.  I am doing great I am more relaxed and happier .  Therapy is key too.  Hang in there and talk to someone!!"	10-Feb-17
139281	Phentermine	"I have been taking this pill since April 21, 2008 when I weighed myself in at 191 lbs. On April 23rd I weighed in at 187.4 lbs and today on the 25th I weigh in at 184.7 lbs. The weight is coming off real well but my concern is the weight is coming off too fast. The pill is great. Overall my goal is 170 lbs I will be there in about 2 weeks if the weight keeps coming off like this - I will update!"	25-Apr-08
96122	Sertraline	"Zoloft treated my symptoms very well. The only problem was my inability to ejaculate. Need less to say, I had to discontinue this medication due to this side effect."	14-Dec-11
128172	Phentermine	"Hey everyone! I found all of these post super helpful! I just started phentermine 37.5 yesterday 04/12/2016 and I&#039;m super excited to see how it will work for me. I currently weigh 248 and it drives me crazy that I let myself gain so much weight. I have always been smaller in size &amp; I gained a lot of weight fast. I first tried toprimate but I took myself off of it because it made my face and hands feel like the pins &amp; needles after your foot falls asleep! So far with phentermine I have had a super dry mouth, hopefully that is the only side effect I have to deal with. I will re post in about a month with my progress. Wish me luck!!!"	14-Apr-16

For the past 8 months I do 3 days strength/weights &amp;4 days cardio, spending 6-7 hours per week at the gym or outside activity like hiking. It was puzzling to me as to why I hadn&#039;t lost a single pound. Got bloodwork &amp;results were PERFECT- no diabetes, no high cholesterol, no hypoactive thyroid, no high blood pressure. Doctor prescribed Phentermine &amp; in 1 week I lost 11lbs! It seemed this was a &quot;magic weight loss pill.&quot; Weeks 2, 3, and 4 I  only lost 1lb each, bringing my total 1 month loss to 14lbs. 2 months to go! "	21-Jun-14
71938	Tramadol	"CAUTION!  Used tramadol 50 mg for back pain. Started with 1 tab couple of days/wk, eventually up to a tab/day, finally tab/day and 2 tabs/day a couple days/week. Withdrawal would kick in about 18-24 hrs after last dose. Lethargy, tired, felt like the flu. Took tab, w/in an hour felt great. Read about this as potential problem, began to wean myself off. Took several months. Every step down resulted in above withdrawal symptoms (but worse), and the most horrible part was the restless body (RLS, but all over) at night when trying to sleep. Felt ready to explode. After taking 1/4 tab/day for weeks, used some leftover partial valium tabs to finally break free from tramadol.  Avoid tramadol if at all possible - withdrawal is absolutely horrible."	25-Jul-15
204098	Escitalopram	"Lexapro made me crazy. Everything from dry mouth, violent nightmares, violent kicking in my sleep, suicidal feelings, weird brain twitching, and many more symptoms. I started taking this medicine because it was deemed as the &quot;miracle pill&quot;, however my experience was not pleasant. However, I have personally seen friends of mine use it and it has changed their lives.."	13-Feb-14
71844	Tramadol	"I have lost 5 pounds on this drug Tramadol.  I was on a weight loss journey and had lost 65 pounds on my own but as of recently, I have struggled with the last 40 until I started taking the Tramadol.  It will suppress your appetite and help with food cravings. I believe this drug is a great aid for losing weight if one uses it appropriately. This drug was not prescribed for depression nor weight loss but it is killing two birds with one stone in my life."	20-Mar-16
141773	Escitalopram	"I took this medicine for both my depression and anxiety.  In the first week I had a really dry mouth and was lightheaded and couldn&#039;t really concentrate on anything but that passed.  It just about cured my anxiety; I can&#039;t even express how grateful I am. While being on it (after the initial 6 wk period), the only time I really suffered from anxiety was in situations where any NORMAL person would start getting anxious and it never escalated to the point of tears and having to lock myself in a bathroom.  As for the depression, it helped a lot but after 18 months of being on the maximum dose, I guess my body has built up a tolerance to it and I now need to change over to something else. I&#039;ve gone back to crying every day. Was great while it lasted."	21-Jun-11
64243	Sertraline	"I literally developed anxiety and intrusive thoughts over night. I kept telling myself that it was a phase, i was stressed, it will pass, 11 months later this was not the case.I tried all the natural remedies there are, and had no permeant relief. I felt so alone, as i hated telling the people i love how i was feeling inside, as it was so unlike me. I finally started taking Sertaline, and have been on it for 5 weeks now, the first 4 weeks I saw a MASSIVE improvement, it was such a relief, and i experienced no side affects, apart from slight difficulty reaching orgasm, im feeling my anxiety creep back in however, not sure if its just a blip or if i should put up my dose from 50mg. Im going to speak to my doctor but has anybody else had this?"	15-Nov-16
96352	Sertraline	"I started taking Zoloft about 3 1/2 weeks ago. The first week I started to feel better. Though about 5 days in I had a really bad hotflash where I had to lay on the floor for about 5 minutes, and then I felt like I was going to throw up. Haven&#039;t had that sense. I do feel tired so I&#039;ve started taking it at night. Also, I feel like I have restless leg syndrome. But other than those things I am now able to focus and my OCD seems to have calmed down a lot. I still get anxious, but it doesn&#039;t stick around as long and I&#039;m able to move on from it easier. I feel like I can live in the moment and not worry about my past or present or what issue I need to stop before it happens. I am able to focus better at work too. I think my husband likes me now."	13-Aug-09

64303	Sertraline	"I started Zoloft about a week ago. I think I feel better. My anxiety and the what if thoughts does not seem to bother me as much. I still feel sad at times. I am going to stay on it longer to get the full effect.  Side effects: loss of appetite, stomach pain, headache, mood swings.  I was in a bad place. My anxiety was terrible. Racing thoughts my brain just would not shut off. I had no control. Its just a really bad feeling. I didn&#039;t want to try any medicine I put it off for a week but my doctor kept calling me and convinced me to come in. She said PPD is a real thing and its nothing I did wrong. I felt ashamed of my feelings. I should be happy I just had a beautiful healthy newborn baby. All I felt was sad and worried about everything."	29-Sep-16
96323	Sertraline	"I started taking Zoloft 50mg yesterday.  I feel a lot better in terms of my mood.  However, I am jittery.  My hands are trembling, pupils are dilated and have dry mouth.  I do understand that I have to let it work its way into my system so I&#039;m sticking with it.  It&#039;s been 1 day!  I&#039;m glad to see that some of the positive responses had the same immediate side effects that I&#039;m dealing with right now.  I am giving it a chance to work, honestly haven&#039;t felt anxious all day."	25-May-10
139121	Phentermine	"I took phentermine for a month and lost 28lbs. IN A MONTH!! Talk about killing your appetite. My family was getting worried because I never wanted to eat. I had to remind myself to eat at 6:00. I told them not to worry because this is what I wanted (to not sit around and think about food all day). People are talking calories this and work-out that, but on phentermine, you automatically exercise because you have this amazing amount of energy that just keeps you going and keeping your mind off of food. It works and I love it."	25-Dec-08

My energy level is high and my appetite is low!! I&#039;m not counting calories but I&#039;m eating  healthy food in smaller portions. As I said in my 1st post, my seizure condition limits outside exercise but I&#039;m staying very busy doing everything VERY fast inside my house! HA!

141219	Escitalopram	"I&#039;m introverted and suffered some depression and anxiety due to a recent IRS audit and personal problems at home , I landed in the hospital for 4 days after test on my heart etc everything cleared but stress and anxiety , I&#039;m 40 and in good shape , Dr put me on Lexapro , first two weeks were brutal , emotional rollercoster and insomia, I asked my Dr if he was sure these were not estrogen pills. After two weeks I started to feel awesome , better then before I&#039;m on my eighth week and lost weight , motivated to go to gym , tolerate my wife&#039;s extroverted friends , I feel better then I did my entire life , even before my depression issues , crowds and loud people go over my head nothing irritates me anymore , sexual sides I last longer win win"	7-Jun-15
140937	Escitalopram	"Helped me alot with daily symptoms like chest and rib tightness, which made me think this was a heart condition. Several test proved wrong. Great with controling anxiety symptoms, however issue with thinking clearly or hold a thought for to long."	14-Dec-15
72458	Tramadol	"Takes all my pain away no side effects."	20-Feb-12
138596	Phentermine	"I have used phentermine in the past and lost a lot of weight but over the years I stopped taking it coupled with no exercise, bad bad bad eating habits, on top of a stressful life, and lack of sufficient amount of rest I gained all my weight back and high blood pressure. Today is 1/26/13. I will start the pills on Monday 1/28/13 I have 50lbs to lose. Here I go again but the pills will help me as they have in the past. "	26-Jan-13
72342	Tramadol	"Tramadol does not work for me I still have a lot of pain after using it and I get bad headaches and leg cramps"	29-Jan-12
97038	Ambien	"I have been taking Ambien on and off for 8 years for severe insomnia, mostly related to anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder. Over time my body has built up a dependence and a tolerance. I will lay awake till 5 am if I don&#039;t take it miserable and exhausted for days. The generic doesn&#039;t seen to work as well and since I have been on it so long I usually have to take 20mg to get a full nights sleep, but with certain generics I still wake up at 3am and can&#039;t go back to bed. It has been a God send over the years as I tried everything else. I was treated for depression but those medications made it harder to sleep. At some point I would like to stop being dependent on the medicine but every time I try to quit I go through weeks of with no sleep."	4-Feb-14
72599	Tramadol	"No relief at all. No upset stomach or any other side effects."	27-Jun-10
140741	Escitalopram	"I started taking this med for anxiety a few weeks ago. I had a few side effects like nausea and headaches and I wasn&#039;t sure if it was doing anything. I talked to my doc and he added xanax for 10 days to jump start the Lexapro. It has helped a lot. What mostly helped with my side effects was taking the meds late evening. Now i have no side effects and feel great."	24-Jul-16
214645	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve always had GAD, but ever since starting high school it&#039;s gotten x10 worse. Even though I would go see a therapist, and while it did help with coping, all of my anxiety symptoms I was experiencing got in the way of me living a normal life. I got on cipralex starting with 2.5 mg for a week, gradually increasing, now on 7.5 mg. I can honestly say that ever since starting this medication, my anxious thoughts are way better than they were, I can drive to a friends house without feeling anxious, the constant  &quot;what if&quot; thoughts are gone, my bowel movements are much better, I&#039;m socializing with people more, I barely cry, I see more colours and smells etc. I strongly recommend to teens struggling, because no one should have to :)"	19-Jul-17
140495	Escitalopram	"Hi there, I&#039;m 35 years old male, have strong anxiety and panic attacks 5 years ago.  I&#039;m getting worse 2 months ago, I can&#039;t go out from home, or stay alone in the house, so my therapist decided we had to change my medication. Before this I took only miratazapine. This time I combined with SSRI  -1st try: 5 mg/day : extreme anxiety-nausea-diarrhea. On the day 7th I quit.  -2nd try: 10 days later, this time with xanax (2x0.5 mg): First 3 days I took 5 mg/day, no side effects. From the day 4th, I took 7.5 mg/day: no diarrhea, but my anxiety getting worse, extreme, non-stop nausea, I ate maybe 1 or 2 bananas/day. From day 15th, side effects still here + I couldn&#039;t sleep, feeling tired and depressed. On the 18th I quit.  Not for me."	12-Nov-16
95821	Sertraline	"On 50mg for 4 weeks then increased to 100mg for depression, panic attacks and obsessional thinking. I had few side effects, a slight hand tremor, yawning and difficulty sleeping. The only thing that lingered was the insomnia, but now that has settled down and I sleep okay. I feel so much better, panic attacks gone, obsessive compulsive disorder gone and my mood is lifting daily. I am enjoying life again and this medicine has been so right for me."	18-Apr-14
128451	Phentermine	"I started taking phentermine 37.5 half a pill a day  5days a week then skipped two days. Start date was Sept 2nd weight was 258 today is sept 30th and I  am now at 240!!! Only side affect felt was dry mouth."	30-Sep-15
141619	Escitalopram	"I was prescribed Lexapro 6 years ago for general anxiety disorder and mood swings due to premenopause.  This medicine helped me tremendously with very few side effects.  I did gain 30 lbs and had at least 1 nausea episode a day that would last for a couple of minutes.  Other than that, I felt much better.  I decided a few weeks ago to get off the medicine and weened myself slowly.  After a week without it, the anxiety returned.  I&#039;m now back on 5 mg and only after a few days am beginning to feel myself again."	3-Jun-12
141832	Escitalopram	"I quit my job teaching due to anxiety and panic attacks. After being off work for two years I thought the stress of not teaching would help with my anxiety and panic attacks. I was just a bit better. I thought that eliminating the stress from teaching would make a huge difference in the way I felt. My anxiety and panic attacks continued even when I did not work. I realized I needed medication because I continued to have heart palpitations, shortness of breath, shaking, feeling of being smothered, etc. I have been on Lexapro for four weeks. WHAT A POSITVE DIFFERENCE! It feels so good to feel good! Side effects went away. Other medications I tried caused constipation. Have hope that you will find something that works for you!"	8-Aug-11
138924	Phentermine	"I started this medication on Monday November 30th, and have been on it for 6 days. I have lost 10 pounds. I do notice that I have frequent headaches and I also have a dry mouth but aside from that it works great as an appetite suppressor. Great Product."	6-Dec-09
95970	Sertraline	"I have been taking it for about 6 months now. At first a few side effects here and there so started taking it at night (50mg daily). Two weeks or so later felt it begin working. Was awesome for a good 4 to 5 months and now I feel as though my anxiety is crawling its way back into my life. I&#039;m not sure whether it is just a phase. I went up half a tablet more with my dosage but I still feel my anxiety pushing in my chest."	19-May-13
140671	Escitalopram	"I was diagnosed with severe anxiety in spring of 2015. It was so bad I couldn&#039;t leave my bed for weeks without feeling like I was going to be sick. I finally forced myself to go see a psychiatrist where she prescribed me 10mg of lexapro which was a little too much to start with considering I am very sensitive to medication. I dropped to 5mg and stayed on that dose for almost a year and felt great. I got off all medication for a few months this past summer in hopes of healing on my own, but my anxiety got worse than ever, so I just started 10mg a few weeks ago. Still experiencing side effects (fatigue, dizziness, heart palpitations) but have high hopes considering the lowest dose still worked wonders for me."	27-Sep-16
141676	Escitalopram	"Completely removed my anxiety! I had panic attacks every single night prior to taking Lexapro and after the first few weeks of the Lexapro getting into my system, the anxiety has stopped altogether. I&#039;ve never felt better in my life."	12-Jan-13
72225	Tramadol	"I have found that this medication not only relieves my chronic pain but I am able to take it and still work- I could not do that with the standard narcotic pain relievers which are typically prescribed. Thanks to my doctor&#039;s recommendation of this medicine I am able to live a much less painful and much more fulfilling life."	5-Aug-13
64249	Sertraline	"Long story short I finally felt compelled to try anti depressants. I had experienced depression for a couple of years and had bouts of anxiety. Last straw were symptoms similar to bipolar disorder. Like mania. I had been so reluctant to try meds. But man I&#039;m glad I did. I&#039;m sad I didn&#039;t try them before. My life these couple years would have been so much better, less traumatic. I started 50 mg of sertraline in July. Right away I noticed my mood improved. I used to be short tempered. Now I am more patient. I stopped crying every two days out of frustration due to my sons tantrums or misbehaviour.( challenging toddler) or from feeling overwhelmed with house work.  Little by little that fog of depression started to dissipate. I am happy now."	30-Dec-16
71821	Tramadol	"I take  2 50 mg of tramadol at 4 PM for backaches,thought they would be like an aspirin but wow no pain in the evenings! and I realize I have a calm mind  not wasted or anything just a feeling of calm,can stand up right away without pain in my lower back and I only need tramadol during the middle of the weekTuesday to Thursday or Wednesday to Friday,if you don&#039;t want to be a druggie use tramadol."	6-May-16
95863	Sertraline	"Diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder I was very hesitant at the start to try medications and thought I&#039;ll battle through with the help of therapy. 3 months later I gave in for medication. Couldn&#039;t get through a day without my anxiety being an obstacle. Was prescribed Zoloft for the first time at 25mg. For the first week things were fine just the usual upset stomach and dry mouth nothing I couldn&#039;t handle but surprisingly it made me depressed (never was) but anxiety DID settle a little (hence 5/10). Then was pushed up to 50mg... the upset stomach stopped the dry mouth decreased but restlessness and insomnia kicked in including the zombie feeling. This went on for over 2 weeks but had to stop, it was affecting my work. Withdrawal symptoms, depression."	21-Jul-14
63852	Sertraline	"I was on Zoloft for about 3 years when I was a teenager. It tremendously helped my depression. There were side effects however. My doctor told me that it metabolized slowly and takes a few weeks to notice results.. so in my ignorance, I thought that that&#039;s how long it takes the body to metabolize the stuff. For at least a year there would frequently be times where I&#039;d forget to take my pill in the morning.. sometimes for a few days in a row. So when I remembered that I should take it, I would take 2,3, or even 4 of them to make up for days where I skipped. Like I said, this is only due to my own stupidity. I would end up being awake ALL night long.. completely stung out and not knowing why. I developed Insomnia and pretty much went crazy."	1-Sep-17
72340	Tramadol	"Tramadol has been little short of a miracle for me. Was first prescribed in mid-90s for painful back injury. Used it off and on since then when pain flared up. For about the last 4 years, have been taking Tramadol daily, either 50 or 100 mgs. Have never had need, urge or whatever to increase dosage. "	3-Feb-12
72523	Tramadol	"Tramadol is a very good medication for moderately severe pain. For Bad Pain, taking it with an NSAID markedly improves it&#039;s effectiveness, as you are now acting systemically on both the inflammation and neurologic components of pain. Taking it with a caffeinated beverage, (such as cola, or coffee, etc), can also help, as can B Complex &amp; Magnesium.  Hot or Cold packs to the affected area (depends if the painful area feels Hot or Cold, one will make it better, the other one makes it worse usually in my experience). Also massage may also help. Acupuncture works synergistically I have found. Note: There are many &quot;Generics&quot; for this Med, Only the original &quot;Brand&quot; &amp; The Mylan Generic really work the same in my experience."	24-Mar-10
128419	Phentermine	"Second month update...I lost 8lbs this month. I was hoping for more but I have not been able to get up to go to the gym due to insomnia.  I am a morning workout person (before work). I have no problem falling asleep but usually wake up after only 3 hrs and then I cannot fall back asleep until right before it is time to get up. As exhausted as I am my next dose of phentermine gets me through the day but it has become a vicious cycle.  Today I skipped phentermine for the first time as my body needs sleep and I plan to resume tommorow.   Another side  effect I have experienced is constipation but a stool softener took care of that for me.  Overall phentermine has been very helpful . I have been alternating my calorie consumption ."	4-Sep-15
64527	Sertraline	"took it after baby was born in September 2015 felt normal again in December so I decided to get off. Felt fine until about a week ago in April. 2nd day on it. Makes u feel jittery and crazier for a few days but I know it will get better if I stay on it. definitely recommend not being alone first week u are on it and make sure u have some help!!!"	8-Apr-16
95959	Sertraline	"I have been going through some really tough times, job loss and a terminally ill partner and I have been experiencing a lot of anxiety as a result.  My Dr prescribed Zoloft.  If anything Zoloft made things worse, I tried sticking it out for three months but the ongoing nausea, increased anxiety, jaw clenching, restless legs and insomnia were just too much to cope with along with everything else.  It also numbed me and made me very indifferent to things.  To cut a long story short I stopped after three months and have changed to Citalopram.  Citalopram has lifted my mood without all of the side effects I experienced on Zoloft."	4-Jul-13
64377	Sertraline	"I was prescribed 50mg of this drug to overcome my depression and anxiety due to a stressful situation in my life. I lasted 4 days on this drug. I had brain fog, headaches, dizziness and heightened anxiety, which made me feel worse. The doctor did warn me that it can make side effects worse for 4-6 weeks, then you gradually start to feel better. He asked me to persevere with it, but as a mother of 2 young kids, I couldn&#039;t handle the side effects. I was literally bed ridden. I had to ask my mother to help me with the kids, as the side effects were too much. I called my doctor and relayed the symptoms to him and was advised to discontinue the drug, if I felt it was too much. It took 2 days for the side effects to wear off."	11-Sep-16
127434	Phentermine	"Hey guys checking in again. So when I started I was 198 and now I weigh 145 !!!! This pill is simply amazing!! I&rsquo;m closer to my goal weight which is 130! If you&rsquo;ve been reading my previous reviews you&rsquo;ll know everything!!! I still have the blurry vision but that&rsquo;s it. And it comes and goes now. Also. I skip the pill some days, so that I can see if I can eat good without it. And I do well. Bcuz I&rsquo;m a min I won&rsquo;t qualify to take it anymore. So if you&rsquo;re having doubts. I say DONT doubt!! Take it and watch the weight FALL!!!!  I&rsquo;ll check back in when I&rsquo;m off it guys :)"	24-Oct-17
140882	Escitalopram	"Overall, for me, Lexapro was very destructive. I was on it for about three months and in that time my depression worsened, but that&#039;s not necessarily the worst part. The debilitating panic attacks that put me in the hospital was the worst part. After cutting the dose from 10 mg to 5 mg and not seeing any difference, I discontinued it. Bad depression, bad anxiety, bad drug overall; at least for me anyway."	5-May-16
64652	Sertraline	"I was originally nervous about taking this medication, but I reluctantly began taking 25 mg in the evening. After 3 weeks I definitely noticed a great improvement in my mood, but my sleep or lack of it, was miserable. After the 4th week on sertraline and .5 mg of clonazepam at night, I honestly feel back to normal with normal sleep patterns and appetite. I am at week 6 on both meds and life is great! Trust your doctor, take the meds. Get back to enjoying life!"	16-Nov-15
128741	Phentermine	"This pill works!  I do advise that you eat breakfast wait 30 mins and drink water throughout the day. If you don&#039;t get hungry eat something wholesome. My experience with headache, and mood swings was due to me not feeling hungry, yet my body still needed fuel. Listen to your body! I&#039;m at a weight that I&#039;m happy with. I do exercise its my therapy. One seventy three from 205! Also it helps with my blood pressure. Eating is so much easier. I can think about what I need to prepare versus just grabbing the first snack, not so good choice that would satisfy me. Know your body, breath don&#039;t over think, be happy. This is coming from me!It helped along with small positive changes. Peace!!"	25-Mar-15
34211	Tramadol	"I have been on so many muscle relaxers and pain control medications while waiting for hip replacements that it was unbelievable. About four years ago my Doctors (Air Force Type) put me on a steady regimen of tramadol 50mg tabs up to 300mg per day dependent on pain and I have been able to completely manage my pain and even walk in short bursts (Sometimes with a cane but that&#039;s still walking in my condition) it is an amazing revelation."	8-Mar-09
64783	Sertraline	"Sertraline has been a life-saver for me. I started getting panic attacks just after Christmas and had probably been mildly depressed for a year or so. I&#039;d also started to become anxious all the time and convinced myself that I was on the verge of a Heart Attack. Basically, I could go for a whole day with stomach or chest tightness fighting back tears and desperately trying to cling on to a sense of normality.  Antidepressants was the only option I hadn&#039;t tried but it ended up really working well for me. The first 2 weeks were really hard as the drug makes you worse before it makes you better but if you stick with it, the Zombie-like state passes and I would say after 3 weeks I was 50% back-to-normal, 4 weeks 80&amp; and 6 weeks 100%."	1-Jul-15
64258	Sertraline	"When I took this drug I was 7 months pregnant with extreme anxiety and depression. I was sectioned on account of the fact I wanted to commit suicide and had taken myself to hospital in a desperate attempt to get help before I did something stupid. It was the worst time of my life.     The first week of taking the drug saw my symptoms worsen and the side effects were horrendous. I&#039;ve seen hell and it was that first week or two. It took two months for the drug to reach its full potential with therapy. The side effects don&#039;t last. My baby is 2 now and I&#039;m glad I took sertraline; it saved out lives. Depression is a physical illness like any other and needs treatment. Suicide is the result of untreated depression. Seek help if you feel depressed."	22-Dec-16
141718	Escitalopram	"Lexapro helped me a lot with my anxiety disorder / ADD symptoms ... The only thing is that Lexapro alone was not super effective for me, but when combined with Adderall and Klonopin it works amazingly -- none of the three medicines alone worked particularly well, but all three together work extremely well for anxiety, ADD and insomnia."	26-Feb-12
128710	Phentermine	"I&#039;m an 18yr old female, I used to weigh 115lbs and absolutely loved my body and and then over the past year  had some stressful things happen and I gained 35 pounds. Tomorrow will be one week since I started phentermine, I love it so far. I could count all of the food I&#039;ve eaten on one hand since I started and I used to go from eating out at least once a day sometimes up to three times a day and now I have no desire. If someone offered to take me to my favorite restaurant for free I would turn it down because I literally have no appetite. Only bad thing is without eating I feel a little dizzy and out of energy sometimes but it&#039;s so worth the energy boost in the morning and loss of appetite."	23-Apr-15
128773	Phentermine	"I&#039;ve been taking phentermine for 2 months and I have lost 22 pounds. I haven&#039;t exercised just my normal active life as a mother and student. The only side effect I&#039;ve had is severely dry mouth and no appetite. I literally force myself to eat something"	18-Feb-15
97322	Ambien	"I started taking Ambien back in January 05 after I had gastric bypass, which also means I don&#039;t get the full dose or affect of the medicine. However, last October I was arrested for DUI of having Ambien in my blood. A cop never saw me driving but some crazy old lady did and followed me all the way home to report I crossed over the yellow line at 7:30 in the morning after taking my son to school and thought I was a drunk driver. I had not been drinking at ALL. I had taken a 10 mg pill at 11pm the night before and had been for all these years so I knew how it affected me. When the cops showed up and I (like a dumby) told them what medicines I took they arrested me for DUI of Drugs. They took me to the hospital took my blood, since it showed up I got charged."	27-Sep-09
64144	Sertraline	"I&#039;m 19 years old and have been on sertraline for 4 weeks now they&#039;re definitely starting to work the first week was a few side affects but nothing major just a bit nervous that&#039;s all, I can definitely tell I&#039;m starting to feel better! I use to have 3 panic attacks a day and worry all day everyday but now it&#039;s like I don&#039;t get any anymore maybe now and then I can worry but not as much as I use to , it takes 4-6 weeks to work anyway , they&#039;re amazing I feel so much happier and first time in months I went out for a meal without having a panic attack as the tablets feel like they blank noise out more and I didn&#039;t even concentrate on people around me or I don&#039;t have thoughts about dying going through my head all day everyday anymore ! recommend them!"	4-Apr-17
128852	Phentermine	"I need to lose 30 lbs. I tried every thing, even the HCG diet. I was so hungry on that diet, it made me gain more weight. I tried phentermine 37.5 mg 7 days ago, and I am down 5 lbs. the first day I took it, I didn&#039;t eat all day long. It was weird and scary at the same time. I just wasn&#039;t hungry at all. My energy level was at the highest I ever felt. I had to keep moving. The next day, my body started getting use to the pill. I don&#039;t night snack any more. My last meal is around 7pm. If I start exercising I will probably lose more weight faster. side effects: thirsty all the time, but that helps me to get my 8 glasses of water intake. Sometimes I feel kind of emotional. that&#039;s about it."	3-Aug-14
71742	Tramadol	"I have been taking tramadol for over 10 years now. I take 2 50mg pills 3x a day. I have found a huge difference in the generics. I thought mylan was the best , but the last few months something has changed. Its almost like the mylan pills are fake. They don&#039;t work at all. They only give me a headache. I used to take amneal until those stopped working. So this month i went to a different pharmacy and got the zydus brand even though i have read bad reviews of zydus brand tramadol. After 1 hour of taking my first dose it was like night and day. These work great. It was almost like the first time I took hydrocodone. I had little pain, my pain went from an 8 to a 2 . I dont take these to get high but I had a warm fuzzy itch all over my body."	1-Dec-16
140798	Escitalopram	"Have had anxiety for a few years but the last couple months it started taking over my life, couldnt go shopping cause id have a panic attack at the counter.My work life become unbearable, to the point i wouldnt go to work.So i started drinking to help me and it did at first. But the more i drank the more out of control my life become,Was like watching a slow moving car crash an i couldnt do anything.thats when i knew i needed help. Have been on 10ml escitalopram for 4 days now and i feel great woke this morning feeling like a cloud has been lifted, my anxiety lvl is 5 from a 10. So this drug might not be a miracle drug but its helping me live just that little bit better"	25-Jun-16
138542	Phentermine	"Started taking phentermine, August 30, 2013. Weighed in at 219lbs. Weighed on Sept 4 at 212lbs. So it is working. I don&#039;t have a lot of energy. I was working out 2 to 3 days a week before I started. So today I&#039;m taking B12 supplement to see if that will help me. Overall it&#039;s okay and I need this weight off of me. It&#039;s not attractive."	7-Sep-13
71717	Tramadol	"Although I think it is great that people read up on medications that they take, I cannot stress enough how important it is to make sure this medication is prescribed by a doctor who has examined you, knows your biology and knows what meds you should take. Too many people lose their lives taking meds not prescribed for them, or mixing with otc meds or drinking alcohol. Be safe. This drug worked great for my back pain.  I am glad my doctor chose it for me."	23-Feb-17
128557	Phentermine	"I&#039;ve only been on phentermine 37.5 since June 23, 2015.  My starting weight was 220 at 5&#039;5&quot; and this morning I weighed in at 214.8.  I take it every morning as soon as I get up in the morning with 1-2 cups of water.  It does make me really thirsty (so I have been drinking more water) and the first few days, my sleep was so off and I felt really jittery. I have definitely noticed that I don&#039;t eat as much. Even if I try to eat a lot, I feel bad so I don&#039;t try much :)  I try to attend boot camp 1-3 times a week.  I can&#039;t wait to see results within the next week and days to come."	1-Jul-15
128024	Phentermine	"Second day taking it. Today I felt weird no energy just concentrated on things more. No appetite but made myself eat something small and healthy every three hours. I have 110 lbs to lose I hope this helps I walk at night after work and gym in morning for a hour."	19-Aug-16
96080	Sertraline	"Just started taking sertraline, same day right away I felt weird, my head started to hurt. Felt like sunburn, numbness, pain but then also keep getting major anxiety with it so I took Advil with it. Called my doctor he said that those were all normal side effects that would disappear in a couple of weeks but pain is awful."	1-Jun-12
141861	Escitalopram	"If you just started Lexapro and are considering quitting because of the side effects - don&#039;t! Trust me. Wait it out. It gets so much better. The first month I took Lexapro, I was extremely nauseous and anxious, and couldn&#039;t sleep at night. I&#039;ve been on it now for six months and feel like a completely new, better person. The only side effect I experience is occasional drowsiness. I can sleep at night, I have no sexual side effects, and I haven&#039;t gained any weight. Also: Do NOT taper off this medicine without consulting your Doctor first and having him/her help you through it. If you take yourself off it (especially cold turkey) it will be horrible for you. Be smart and stay strong. The good definitely outweighs the bad."	19-Aug-10
127406	Phentermine	"Started Phentermine 37.5mg about 10 days ago. Weight 199LB and 5&rsquo;8. MD suggested due to health problems aNd impaired mobility. Week one I lost 5 lbs and only took the pill 2 days, skip a day, one pill, and skip a day again. I could barely eat bites of food... that&rsquo;s why I staggered the dose. I was only extremely thirsty and felt  &ldquo;off&rdquo; so I&rsquo;d force myself to eat fruit, or something small.  I really want the weight off but I know diet and exercise are a must... No magic pill....just short term booster. I do exercise 3 x week light low impact. I plan to work hard with healthy eating, exercise, and this pill as needed. I&rsquo;m thankful for the assistance, but realistically learning to have healthy habits is keyâ¤ï¸"	25-Nov-17
64163	Sertraline	"This medicine is allowing me to focus on what is important. Started on 50mg, had feelings of euphoria for the first couple of days, then a few of the regular side effects such as little sleep, nausea and suicidal ideation, which eventually all passed. I also had bloodshot eyes for a while, most likely due to lack of sleep and working night shift.   I have gone up to 100mg as I was feeling anxiety effects in the evening and had started taking one at night as well as in the morning.   I am not worrying about the smaller things, important events still cause me some anxiety but I am able to tackle them with a clearer mind instead of the anxiety crippling my ability for action.   I can tell this medication will help me get my priorities in order."	11-Jan-17
140870	Escitalopram	"For me personally, I hated Lexpro.  It made me a shell of the person I used to be and like others have described, a walking zombie.  I couldn&#039;t connect with my emotions whatsoever. There are much better SSRI&#039;s available!"	22-May-16
140978	Escitalopram	"For the past 3 years I&#039;ve suffered from increasingly bad Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I also had mild OCD, by the end of the third year I was having regular panic attacks.  I tried accupuncture, CBT, herbs, supplements and Lorazepam (I took about 5 pills over a year)  but nothing worked. I was completely against taking anti-depressants until I just couldn&#039;t get out of bed for a week.   I  was prescribed Cipralex. I take 5mg a day.  The change is amazing. I feel like my old self again. The tightness in my chest is gone. I do still get anxiety in the morning and especially on Mondays but I hear that will subside as the drug regulates in my system. I feel like I can handle my stresses again. I&#039;m still doing CBT to work on stress."	23-Mar-16
64176	Sertraline	"Gave one star to Zoloft for its effort, but really it deserves zero stars from my experience. I was on Remeron, then Cipralex (Lexapro for American users) for almost a year and when it stopped working I decided to go with Zoloft after reading good reviews. Zoloft slowly turned me into the worst version of myself. Constant anger, irritation, nausea, no appetite, no motivation, and man the heart burn was unreal. And the list goes on and on. I took it for a week at 25mg and 3 weeks at 50mg to give it a shot but I had to stop because I was just falling apart. I am currently on Effexor, its been almost a week and it is slowly putting me back together from the Zoloft disaster."	14-Mar-17
128032	Phentermine	"I started Phentermine 37.5mg daily on 8/3/16. My weight was 272 while at my physical with my doctor. I had been exercising and watching my diet for about  3 weeks prior to that and lost 17 pounds. This morning marks one week of taking phentermine and i weighed in at 265. I use this pill to help resist temptations, not to stop me from eating or drop caloric intake. Yes, I can tell that I am not hungry all the time but I still make myself eat something light and healthy. My goal is to lose weight, not end up in a hospital. I exercise at least four times a week in which I prefer to walk briskly. I truly believe it has made a huge difference in my outcome. I have energy throughout my day and I sleep well at night."	10-Aug-16
128330	Phentermine	"Male, age 49. I&#039;ve climbed the ladder to a nice cushy office job with little or no walking. Regular days are 12-16 hours, leave when it&#039;s dark come home when it&#039;s dark. A co- worker introduced me to his doctor for a wellness visit, he prescribed phentrimine 30 mg and I&#039;ve lost 14lbs in 30 days. I honestly have very little time away from work and this loss in weight was simply smaller portions, lots of water and having enough self control to eliminate all high fructose corn syrups and eat lots off veggies, and no fast food. Enjoy and don&#039;t bow to temptation."	10-Dec-15
140653	Escitalopram	"Lexapro helped me a lot!  I&#039;m on 10mg and therapy to talk through my issues I didn&#039;t realise the tight feeling in my chest was anxiety...I felt like I had that all day. It completely went away. I take it at night, the downsides are I was always active, the gym was my hobby, when on lexapro I felt not interested at all in exercise and couldn&#039;t lift weights like I used to, and I&#039;d be tired in workouts. I often feel tired during the day and could nap, sex Drive is lowered. The plus sides are I am a lot more relaxed, able to think things through properly and it is rare for me to cry now. I don&#039;t worry and I enjoy life, I&#039;m still myself just more relaxed, I am in a positive place. I am just slowly tapering down my medication for more energy :)"	9-Apr-17
140481	Escitalopram	"I developed terrible heart palpitations on Lexapro and had to stop using it. Unfortunately the heart palpitations are still occurring even though I have been off the drug for almost 3 months."	6-May-17
95679	Sertraline	"My doctor prescribed 100mg for me when my symptoms start getting really bad before my period.  I have PMDD. It&#039;s a severe form of PMS. Then 50mg throughout the rest of the month for my mild depression.  Yesterday was my first day taking it, and I immediately felt effects.  I was calm, kinda zoned out, which is what I wanted since I&#039;m always on edge.    The symptoms from PMDD are hurting my family and I&#039;m really hopeful that this medicine will work."	9-Dec-14
72329	Tramadol	"Tramadol has been very effective for my severe restless legs syndrome. However the body does seem to build tolerancce so you must increase dose from time to time. The withdrawal effects are quite severe. I found that a slow withdrawal helps ease the discomfort. I have also been on Neurontin in the past and had good results for several years but the effectiveness seems to lessen over time and increasing the dose did not help. "	30-Jun-11
97037	Ambien	"Great. Just take them 5 mins before bed."	17-Feb-14
138468	Phentermine	"I was at 185 now 174!! So far 11lb down in a little less than two weeks.. super excited! My goal weight is 130-135. 185 is the most i ever weighed..i dont think i look it, but the scale doesn&#039;t lie! Lol. Ive had a few symptoms so far...dry mouth, lasts all day whether i chew gum, drink water. Insomnia is horrible, i can have three hours of sleep and be fine all day. I use to get really jittery and want to move around but so far i havent been super hyper like i was. Today i felt my hands and feet tingling not bad though. I have also had a headache the past two days...which it may not even be from this hopefully itll go away. I also would have hot.flashes but then get cold. Overall im just excited to see results!!"	9-Nov-13
64384	Sertraline	"Never written a review in my life. Was often on these sites reading peoples experiences and hoping 1 day i would be me again. Im not me , im happier then i can remember . When your used to living with anxiety daily you dont realise how it actually feels to be &quot;normal&quot;. Suffered panic attacks at night that came from absolutely nowhere, no warnings or triggers and gradually effected my day to day life. Started 50mg, first 2 weeks side effects were pretty harsh ; insomnia , increase anxiety , nausea. Was having second thoughts at 4 weeks as didnt see much improvement . Week 5 felt like a switch was turned on in my head. Give this drug 6-8 weeks minimum. it has been life changing for me"	6-Sep-16
141847	Escitalopram	"I started with Lexapro about 2 years ago. I was angry at everyone. Someone walking down the street, someone in a car, people I didn&#039;t know let alone my family. I was in pain, working, doing what you have to do and I was mad. This was a great medicine for me. I take many other medicines but this is one I wouldn&#039;t want to give up."	19-Oct-10
64926	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been on zoloft for almost four weeks now and it&#039;s been a life changer I use to suffer from poor impulse control anxiety and bad depression about two weeks in I started feeling better happier like.the feeling of dread has been removed the demon&#039;s are silenced I feel like I want to live I want to succeed it&#039;s like a dream come true ive suffered from drug addiction in the past and since started zoloft I don&#039;t feel the craving that overwhelming desire to get high the only downside to zoloft. Is the restlessness when.trying to sleep but it&#039;s worth the trade off I started on 50 MG and am now at 100mg per day thank god for zoloft"	21-Mar-15
141528	Escitalopram	"I have been on 10 mg of Lexapro for about 6 years.  I am so thankful for this medication.  I am a crying weepy mess without it!"	24-Sep-13
96337	Sertraline	"This drug, the first time I took it, caused my jaw to clench and grind uncontrollably. However, it made me feel VERY good and I have just started to take it routinely (100Mg). Hopefully, it will continue to keep me happy, especially since I&#039;m a freshman in college."	5-Oct-09
64576	Sertraline	"I was diagnosed with depression about 6 months ago and started with a very low dose of prozac. About 3 months later I was institutionalized and switched to Zoloft. Most of the people there for depression were on it and it worked for them. However, it does not work for me at all. I&#039;ve been on 100 mg for about 2 months and I feel jittery when I sit for too long or when I&#039;m trying to sleep, I get really grouchy and rude (which is unusual for me) , and things that only bothered me before make me really depressed."	29-Jan-16
71798	Tramadol	"Several yrs ago I was diagnosed with severe anxiety disorder.  Had back surgery a couple yrs back and was prescribed Tramadol for pain. Turns out Tramadol (50-100 mg/day) works great for anxiety for me. If you take it for anxiety, make sure if asked that you say it is prescribed for pain as well. Several pharmacists tell me if you say it&#039;s for anxiety only, they &quot;have&quot; to report you and your MD and you both may be arrested. Not sure if the pharms are right, but if they are, it appears this is another case where a few abusers screw it up for the rest of us. It was not on the controlled substance list until very recently. In any event in my experience Tramadol is very effective to treat anxiety disorder."	12-Sep-16
128266	Phentermine	"Good results."	26-Jan-16
34110	Tramadol	"This medicine made me itch all over, dizzy, nauseous and break out in cold sweats.  My doctor gave it to me because it was non-narcotic but I&#039;ve never had these side effects with Vicodin."	31-Aug-09
141422	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve been taking Lexapro for about 2 months now.  I have suffered from social anxiety all of my life and finally went to the doctor to get help.  It was the best thing I ever did.  I now can function and feel normal.  I didn&#039;t have any bad side effects from the medicine and have been very pleased with the results.  My day to day life is not filled with me avoiding many situations and I now feel &quot;normal&quot;.  I never expected this medication to work.  My only regret is I didn&#039;t get help sooner."	1-Feb-14
138558	Phentermine	"I started Adipex on January 15, 2013. I am 24 years old  5&#039;5 and my weight during that time was 259lbs sadly. Today it is April 23, 2013 and I have lost 38lbs! I have tried many other diet pills but never had any luck. I have tried to exercise and watch calories without the help of diet pills but it just wasn&#039;t working for me. Yes, there were side effects high blood pressure/high heart rate (WATCH FOR IRREGULAR HEART BEAT), If so call the doctor that gave medicine. As long as I drank a lot of water the side effects decreased and was tolerable. I would recommend this to anyone who has a hard time sticking to diet and exercise. This pill has worked great for me. Drink only water, get rid of sugar. Walk at least on mile a day."	23-Apr-13
96073	Sertraline	"I&#039;m 23 and after 5 years decided to do something about it. I was put on 50mg of Zoloft. To be honest whether it was me being paranoid or what not my panic was worse in that first 3 days then in years. Felt insane and crazy. Stopped it and talked to doctor. He upped it to 100mg and gave me Xanax to take in meantime. I read online 50% of people get worse in the first few days but then it gets better (brain sensitivity to mess). I do feel calmer (been a week) but barely eat and I can barely get to sleep. I also wake up shaky out of the blue when I do go to sleep and have to take a Xanax to calm me down and put me back to sleep. I&#039;m hoping to get counseling too. I&#039;m hoping this will help. 1 week down... It&#039;s hard being patient."	29-Jun-12
214567	Escitalopram	"Already the first day, my headaches stopped and my tenseness in my body. My mood evened out, I woke up ready to take on the day. I have struggled with a mild depression / anxiety for several years after a stress collapse. Wish I had started medication much earlier, it would have saved me a lot of suffering. Already 5 mg helped. I now take 10 mg."	11-Dec-17
72491	Tramadol	"I&#039;m lying here wide awake at 3:45 am on my 2nd night of trying to wean myself off tramadol under my doctors orders.  He gave me temazapam as a sleep aid and told me to go from 100 mg to 50 mg of tramadol plus 30 mg of temazapam.  Last night was okay, woke up feeling pretty good, but tonight I am back to being miserable because of my restless legs syndrome.  He&#039;s never had it, obviously. His concern is that I will require more as I go along.  I&#039;ve been on 100mg tramadol for about 6 months.  I love that I can sleep, but I&#039;m groggy during the day.  If I don&#039;t sleep, I&#039;m groggy as well.  I prefer to sleep!  This RLS has been lifelong, since 8 years old.  Brothers and mother have it as well.  My middle brother just started tramadol tonight.  Will see what he thinks!"	17-May-11
127540	Phentermine	"Height: 5&#039;2.. Starting weight: 194.. Current weight: 186.. Goal weight : 150..  I have been on the pill on and off for 3 weeks. This pill is a great help when I work morning shifts. I have changed my diet a lot so I&#039;m not sure if its the pill or just the change in diet thats helping with the weight loss. But I&#039;ll continue doing what I&#039;m doing and hope the pounds still fall off.This pill definitely gives you energy and makes your throat very dry. It doesn&#039;t make me want to drink more water so that&#039;s still a struggle lol."	3-Aug-17

142025	Escitalopram	"I have tried four different anti-depressants. All, apart from Lexapro, caused intolerable insomnia. I have now taken Lexapro for 3 years and found it to be life altering. I now feel &quot;normal&quot; and my sleep patterns have improved remarkably. My only side effect is slight sexual difficulties, however these have lessened over time."	31-Dec-08
64369	Sertraline	"I have been suffering from depression and anxieties for many years. When I was starting high school, I was prescribed with Paxil, and had taken that for 14 years. During my third year of college, when I was 22, I found out that I had Generalized Anxiety Disorder, because I worried more than the average person. It was only last year that I found out that Paxil was no longer effective, so my doctor suggested that I gradually switch over to Zoloft. My doctor informed me that Zoloft also helps ease anxieties. I took her word for it. Since Paxil and Zoloft are both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, it really is not that hard to make a switch. Zoloft has definitely caused my worries to decrease. I sleep better as well."	28-Jul-16
97304	Ambien	"I was prescribed Ambien for insomnia because I am going through a particularly stressful time in my life. It does put me to sleep quickly but I&#039;ve had several bouts of sleep walking. The last one was two nights ago and this one might actually cause me to stop taking it. My room mate said I got up and started to cut up some chicken then mixed it with some dry dog food. This wouldn&#039;t be bad if I then fed it to my dog but instead, I started feeding it to myself! Thankfully after I took one bite, she said I spit it out so I guess I wasn&#039;t completely out of it. I discovered other things like food taken out of the fridge and sugar spilled on the counter. Other than these things, the drug works great!"	3-Dec-09
64593	Sertraline	"I feel extremely happy and it may be because I am taking sertraline. I, however, believe that the sertraline has helped any anxiety I have felt (I have panic attacks and have self diagnosed OCD - sometimes I feel I must know everything about everything) the anxiety which I no longer feel allows me to think clearly, plan my ideas in a chronological order,  I now know that it&#039;s never going to be the end of the world (hopefully) and discipline myself and my thoughts accordingly. I plan to stay on sertraline only for 6 months longer, and then my discipline should take hold :) I hope this helps x"	18-Jan-16
141029	Escitalopram	"When I first started taking this medication, I was determined to end it all. Four years later, I&#039;m the happiest person I know. I still have a high sex drive, although I&#039;ve known people to say that lexapro takes it away for them. I didn&#039;t gain any weight and I&#039;ve learned through meditation and breathing techniques to handle what small anxiety attacks I may get in my hectic life (two jobs, an apartment, school, long distance boyfriend) and at 20 years old I&#039;m better off than most of my friends and feel like I can accomplish anything. Lexapro saved my life."	20-Nov-15
214576	Escitalopram	"I am about two weeks into taking escitalopram.  The first two days were side effect free. But after that I was vomiting constantly and could barely eat anything. I have lost five pounds and I am already a small girl. I experience very mild headaches here and there. Mostly at night when I am trying to sleep. One minute I am constipated and the next I have diarrhea. Not cool. I cannot eat much at all, have NOT lost any sexual interest. Now that I am two weeks into the medication I am experiencing additional anxiety like heart palpitations and feelings of wanting to break down crying over nothing.  I used to be on a higher dose of &lsquo;citalopram&rsquo; which caused no side effects but this one is hard on my body. Hope it works for my anxiety eventually"	2-Dec-17
96537	Sertraline	"Zoloft was the first medication I was prescribed for Depression.  It worked well in that it kept me from screaming at my family, and elevated my mood.  I was on a low dose of 50mg.  In time, it seemed I became immune to it so I was switched to Prozac because a friend had recommended it."	31-May-08
64648	Sertraline	"Everyone&#039;s Experience with a drug will be different. In my case, being a 6ft, 170 pound male with depression on 50mg of zoloft , I had a good experience. It wont be the same for everyone but you have to hang in there until you find the right medication. I tried lexapro previously 10mg and it was too intense for me. Zoloft is a little bit softer and less intense (for me anyway) . The first two weeks sucked , I had increased anxiety and it was hard to sleep but it was worth it. I was going through withdrawal syndrome from lexapro (i stopped taking it) and the zoloft cured me in about 3 days. it has helped my depression alot, and a little bit of my anxiety. I want to stay on 50mg as long as possible and i am hoping this will last.  I"	21-Nov-15
141675	Escitalopram	"I&#039;m a hoarder. Depressed all my life. My dr. Said lexapro would work. I tried it and took 20mg then 40mg. I don&#039;t go garbage dumping anymore, gained weight and sleeping problems. I don&#039;t know if its working very well. I know I get a little angry without it. I&#039;m taking wellbutrin too. I wish everyone luck."	13-Jan-13
127414	Phentermine	"I started taking phentermine 37.5mg October 18, 2017 once a day. I initially weighed in at 211lb on the date I started taking the medication. As of today November 18, 2017 I have lost 20lbs. I am down to 190lbs!!! I have completely changed my eating habits to no red meats, fried foods, starches, and I try to keep my calorie count right at 1425 per day which was difficult at first but now its much easier. I don&#039;t drink soda of coffee anymore but I&#039;m super thirsty all the time. The first weekend I took the medication it made me very jittery and I suffered from insomnia and horrible headaches. After the first four days of being on the medication my symptoms improved and eventually went away. I would recommend starting this medication on a weekend."	19-Nov-17
64455	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been on Zoloft for 4 years and it&#039;s worked great for my depression. I take 50 mg per day."	26-Apr-16
140788	Escitalopram	"This medication has forever changed my life, it has possibly saved my marriage and relationship with my kids. I am a person who suffers from anxiety and severe mood swings. Before Lexapro I would snap at anything, little things would trigger anxiety attacks and that would lead to depression. My first week on Lexapro was not to bad I had some nausea, felt jittery at times, restlessness at night, and yawning uncontrollably. But I noticed right away and so did my husband that I was more at ease, happier, and was able to blow things off that would of made me blow up before. The pros out weighed the bad for me. So far I have been enjoying life more, laughing with my kids more often and not focusing so much on the little things."	21-Aug-16
64175	Sertraline	"Unfortunately this medication didn&#039;t work for me and I was combining it with exercise on a regular basis. I feel so low most days and I sometimes find it hard to even go out at all. I&#039;m not trying a SNRI to see if that works. On the plus side no side effects at all."	16-Mar-17
138576	Phentermine	"I agree, the best medical weight loss pill out on the market. What made me feel safe was knowing its been around, FDA approved for 60 years. I&#039;ve been on phentermine for a month and a half now and already reached my goal of 135. I lost a total of 20 pounds! I recommend to anyone wanting to lose weight fast."	14-Mar-13
71749	Tramadol	"I was prescribed tramadol by my pain management doctor along with gralise (extended release gabapentin) and epidural cortisone injections for pain from cervical and lumbar stenosis. I loved it at first - it enabled me to resume walking and sleeping through the night. But after 3 months I had upped the number of pills I was taking to the max 400mg/day because I was becoming tolerant to it. When I had to go off it due to surgery I decided to stay off it and experienced unpleasant withdrawal of sweats/chills and loss of appetite for about 4 days. Now I use a TENS device for pain at night (FDA recent approved a new device that can be worn at night) and am off tramadol. Tramadol was not a good long term solution for me."	21-Nov-16

127433	Phentermine	"My doctor prescribed me with phentermine 37.5mg. I&#039;ve recently just started the medicine yesterday on 10/25/2017 and so far I have jitters, a little dry mouth, I&#039;m full of energy, and I have no appetite! The good thing is I feel like I can run a marathon race. I drink plenty of water a day and portion my food intake. I plan on eating healthier and working out daily. My starting weight is 265lb. I plan on going back to my college weight which was 188lb. I&#039;m excited for this journey and to keep you guys updated."	26-Oct-17
214668	Escitalopram	"Day 4 of using this Med- I first I noticed I was very tired and fatigue - I experienced short term memory loss - I also couldn&#039;t stay focused in on a conversation.. Not for me"	24-Aug-17
138684	Phentermine	"I started phentermine 37.5mg in March 2011 and weighed in at 180. By the end of April I was down 20lbs to 160. It gave me energy and really suppressed my hunger, but I had horrible dry mouth, constipation, irritability, and had to force myself to eat. Since I stopped, I have gained 10 lbs back in 7 months and is entirely my fault. I have started it back up again because to me the side effects are worth the outcome. It loses it&#039;s potency after a couple of months, but still suppresses the hunger more than without it. As long as I am dedicated to the program, I should be able to take off the 10lbs I gained and then some within 2 months time. My realistic goal weight is 145 and is totally doable with healthy habits."	1-Dec-11
138534	Phentermine	"Started phentermine on September 6, 2013 weighing at 183.5lbs. I had my appointment at my doctors today and I weighed in at 164.4lbs. I have lost close to 20 lbs in 1 month. I am taking the 37.5 mg pill in the morning and 1/2 at noon. Side effects are dry mouth but I drink lots of water, which is good for me anyway. My goal is 135 lbs and I work out 1 hr 5 days a week."	3-Oct-13
127444	Phentermine	"I was prescribed Adipex by my doctor 9/18/17 and so far so good. I do not own a scale so I am waiting on my monthly doctor visit so that he may monitor my weight loss. The first day I felt like I could run a Marathon and I did not at a thing that day, but drank a lot of water. The next couple days to a week it evened out a little better not as hyper, but enough energy to function. I am taking the 37.5 I take a a half of a pill in the morning and a half in the afternoon as prescribed by my doctor. Your doc may prescribe differently, but this does make the effects of the drug easier to handle. I started off at 250lbs ( I hate to admit) and being only 5&#039;3 I feel terrible about my weight. I want to be at 130 when finished"	10-Oct-17
139030	Phentermine	"I started taking phentermine 37.5mg on May 5 and I have changed the way I eat but mainly just portion control and no sodas and a lot of water. I don&#039;t eat after 8pm and I have lost 6 lbs so far. However I am not experiencing the energy or the appetite suppressing that everyone says. I seem to still feel hungry even after I take the pill. I&#039;m not going to give up - I will give it at least 3 weeks."	10-May-09
95824	Sertraline	"I am a 42 year old man who has been on Sertraline 100mg daily for about 4 years. I was diagnosed with depression and put on medication and saw a psycologist who was no help at all. The medication cured my constant state of anger and irritation and I could actually spend time with my wife and 3 children without flying into a rage! People wonder why I am always laughing and generally happy as well as being extremely laid back about situations. The big down side I have found with this medication is the lack of libido. The brain still wants it but the man stick does not respond too often. It can take an age to ejaculate and keeping an erection can also be a problem. I have gained some weight and I sweat profusely."	9-Apr-14
71829	Tramadol	"I take tramadol for RA.Early on I would take too many in an 8 hr shift as a CNA and find no relief. After a re evaluation of meds my pain is moderate to severe deepening on what I&#039;ve done that day. Otherwise I&#039;m finding my use of tramadol is to keep withdrawals at bay...They are HARSH. More noticeable when I&#039;m trying to sleep. I get extremely tired there is no fighting the urge- except when you try to sleep, Uncontrollable yawning, my whole body becomes HOT, sleep is not an option. Uncontrollable jerking of my arms and legs. Pains in my head, unbelievable gas. Did I mention how hot I get like I&#039;m in an oven. Sensitivity to cool air, like your nerves are exposed, but your hot at the same time.. Down to 2 to 4 a day tho."	15-Apr-16
182047	Acetaminophen / caffeine	"Only thing that really work for headaches but sleeplessness and a recent increased heart rate will make me give them up. Can&#039;t sleep if I take them at night. Sorry but they have to go."	19-May-16

71646	Tramadol	"Had bad luck with Ultram and never took this garbage drug again. I have Chronic Spine Pain and 23 Major Spine Surgeries. I have DJD, bilateral, lumbar adhesive arachnoiditis and Neuropathic pain in left leg ( thigh area) with anterior and lateral nerve damage from lumbar Spine surgery. Now have to take Neurontin 400mg capsules for this leg pain. Also, Ultram made me very uncomfortable and did not like the sensation whatsoever. Did not help my Pain at all and side effects make me tell them I am allergic to the drug. I do not want anything that doesn&#039;t assist my Chronic Spine Pain! There are plenty of opioids that help me so much better. Just have to work well with my Pain Specialist."	4-Sep-17
96139	Sertraline	"I started taking Zoloft after experiencing physical symptoms of anxiety at random moments and cyclical mood swings with depression that had a very strong physical component (I had nothing to be sad about I just ached and couldn&#039;t get out of bed or smile) The first week I took it I felt like I was in a complete fog. I lost my appetite, had upset stomach and it messed up my sleep. Once my body adjusted (about 2 weeks) I had more energy, was more engaging with my friends and family and the physical symptoms subsided. After about 3 months I moved and lost my medicines and stopped abruptly. The depression and anxiety came back tenfold because I didn&#039;t wean myself off. I felt overwhelmed with life. Zoloft works great but it&#039;s very powerful."	1-Nov-11
141317	Escitalopram	"Out of nowhere, due to what they think is genetics, I got hit with depression, anxiety, and a form of OCD in my early twenties. The Lexapro was a life saver. Although, I still have negative thoughts on a daily basis, I&#039;m able to cope, and I&#039;m not miserable like I was. However, there is one common downside to this medicine that has left me terribly upset and frustrated. I&#039;ve been on Lexapro for a year and a half now and have put on about 20 lbs. I work out almost every day and eat right for the most part. I have not shed a pound. I&#039;ve never been this big before and to me, I feel as though Lexapro isn&#039;t worth it anymore. I&#039;m weening off of it with my doctor&#039;s help, and am going to try and cope with my issues with different methods."	16-Nov-14
141755	Escitalopram	"Lexapro made me feel good. I was able to control lashing out and crying. However, after a week of taking, something triggered me again. A horrible thing happened to me and made me take too much alcohol while on this medication. Messed me up and after that, a symptoms keeps coming up. Lexapro really made me hold on to my sanity but suicidal thoughts came up with the symptoms. "	15-Mar-11
71728	Tramadol	"I have been feeling very unhappy for a long time and its a struggle getting by every day. However I took 100 mg of tramadol for some chest pain once and it is like a light bulb was switched on inside me. My social anxiety is also less. However I am worried about taking it more often as I work in a sensitive field where your judgement can be called to question at any time"	2-Feb-17
63902	Sertraline	"Hi, I&#039;ve been struggling with anxiety disorders since age 17, specifically with OCD. I&#039;m 31 right now, decided to give sertraline a try, by myself, I&#039;m on it since March this year, that is like five months, honestly since first day I felt like a switch in my brain, three weeks later and made an appointment with a psychiatrist, because I thought it would be better if a doctor prescribe it to me instead of self medicating. I supposed he would increase my dosage to 100 mg but he said to stay with 50 and it is still working well with that. He also added me Modafinil, Trifluoperazine and Clobazam and doing fine with that combo, I&#039;m gonna review them later. They aren&#039;t miracle, they give you tools for you to keep going well with a good mindset."	14-Aug-17
95976	Sertraline	"Last night was my first night I experienced nausea and dry mouth and a feeling sensation like something was in my throat before I went to sleep. I woke up 5 hours later and I felt like I was going I have an attack because I wasn&#039;t sure what I was feeling was normal but I didn&#039;t have an attack. Normally I would but not this time and I do feel shaky but I see a lot of other people had the same effects. Seems okay so far, I just hope it helps with my anxiety for the most part I suffer from bad anxiety."	2-May-13
128146	Phentermine	"Hi.  I have been taking phentermine 30mg since 23rd April 2016. I have lost 7lbs I currently weigh like 205 I need to get down to 140 really. My symptoms have been dry mouth, interrupted sleep as I wake up like sometimes before 5 and can&#039;t get back to sleep. I was told the sleep pattern will change soon. I have had weight loss which is good but last few days my weight is staying the same where as before everyday would go down at least 1lb. Anyway I guess maybe it is slowing down and it will end up being 2 -3lbs of weight loss a week. But I guess that&#039;s healthier anyway. Oh I am in UK I think that&#039;s why your dosage is higher. They have restrictions here on some of the medication you have there that&#039;s the problem I think."	2-May-16
95741	Sertraline	"I am 39 years old, was a new nurse and struggling with major depression. I had not been to a Dr in years and broke down crying at the first visit. Started 50 mg a day. Felt a little funny first couple days but now feel much better! Everyone noticed a change for the better and even got a promotion at work! Feel so much better and have not had any side effects!"	16-Nov-14
127851	Phentermine	"I started adipex today and took it at 8am this morning...it&#039;s now 10:30 am and I feel hungry and don&#039;t have the energy everyone has talked about...I only took a half of a 37.5 guess I&#039;ll try a whole one tomorrow...."	28-Dec-16
64195	Sertraline	"Zoloft changed my life completely and I feel &quot;normal&quot; pretty much all of the time. I was too phobic to try it and for 15 yrs I suffered. I wish it didn&#039;t have to happen that way. I started literally on 6.25 mg so afraid I&#039;d get ill. Went up to 12.5 then 25 and so on. I&#039;m now on 150mg and have had zero side effects. If you&#039;re like me and phobic of meds, start on a baby dose. Even when the doc looks at you weird, just do it your way for you. You want the lowest effective dose anyway right? Start small and tell yourself this will help and not hurt you before you take it. Each day it gets easier. Best wishes for a better life."	1-Mar-17
34259	Tramadol	"I have been taking Tramadol for about 7 years now off and on. I have suffered from lower lumbar area pain and degenerative disc disease and this is theonly thing that takes the edge off and still allows me to work."	13-Oct-08
72347	Tramadol	"I was first told about tramadol by a friend. I was tired of taking Lortab for a herniated disk, at first it was good but after a few months of going to the doctor I thought maybe I would see if I can stop taking it and so I did. That was the worst week of my life. I went to the doctor at an insta care and was told that I was suffering from withdrawal from the tramadol and addictive. I was shocked my back doctor had told me that it was safe long term and non addictive. I then went to my doctor, he said no, no, but you should never just quit any medicine. So after a year I started taking more of the tramadol noticing I needed more to keep the pain away. "	11-Jan-12
71720	Tramadol	"I&#039;ve been taking Tramadol 50 mg 4x day for 15+ years with no side effects, and very good results.  I have chronic sciatica, acute scoliosis, stenosis, and  arthritis of the spine causing inflammation with swelling in the lumbar area.  I was living with incredible pain till my PCP suggested Tramadol.  What a relief it has been for me.  When needed, I use Ibuprofen for the swelling and inflammation.  It has given me the return to my active life, which includes aerobics, strength training, QiGong and TaiChi.    I have found acupuncture and leg massage the answer for restless legs."	20-Feb-17
139006	Phentermine	"I was on Adipex for 1 year and lost a lot of weight. Before I started this I was 220lbs. When I was done my weight was 160lbs. I lost more inches then I could believe, I went from a size 22 to a size 14. The medicine works. The only thing I don&#039;t like is once I was off the medicine I gained my weight back quick and had a lot of side effects such as depression, moody, cravings, couldn&#039;t sleep at night, headaches. I went through the side effects for about 4 months after I was off the pill."	10-Jul-09
71788	Tramadol	"So for pain there just alright like a 7  they do last longer than other pain pills- but for my deprssion I feel like a better more capable man when I&#039;m on them.  When my supply is gone and I cant find a doc or medical I become suicidal. With them I can live a normal or somewhat normal life"	5-Oct-16
96983	Ambien	"I personally have not taken this medication but my mother has. I am 19 and she started taking it when I was 12. It for the most part helped her insomnia but the side effects were extreme. I would have to stay up until she had fallen asleep because if I didn&#039;t she would do things and not remember them the next morning. She would take our dog for a walk in the dark at 10 at night by herself. There was one occasion where she woke up on our neighbors cement front porch with our dog. She had no recollection of how she got there. She would eat strange things like vineager and ketchup chicken quesadillas, she would fall down the stairs, she would lose things, and she got very addicted. Coming off it was horrible. The night terrors were insane"	17-Sep-15
139102	Phentermine	"I have been on it for about a month on and off and lost 20 pounds. I didn&#039;t excercise at first, but have made it to the gym everyday this past week. It makes you aware of what you eat and how much you eat. I put myself on a strict eating plan of all fruits, veggies, and lean meats.     I have 3 friends who have taken it and it has changed their lives! It is a miracle pill!     I noticed in the beginning I would wake up multiple times a night (but would always have maximum energy all day) so I took a Benadryl at night and it fixed it until I forgot to take it, and I realized I sleep all night without it now!    It has helped me, and for me I don&#039;t consider it a quick fix because I&#039;m more aware of what I consume. Just 40pds more to go for me!"	6-Feb-09
127603	Phentermine	"MARIE501  I wanted to share my first day on Phentermine. I weighed myself this morning at 225.8. I am a diabetic Type 2 and my A1C levels are 13.3! Yikes. I tried the Low Carb High Fat diet and it worked. I lost 8 lbs in week, but it was extremely difficult to continue.  How I feel: This morning after taking pill, I could barely eat! I feel weak, but also energized (weird). I am having dry mouth, but not severe, and blurred vision. Im extremely excited to see how this works for me. Hopefully the diet treats me well.   Tips: Make sure you start on like a Thursday or Friday or weekend, that way you can experience the symptoms at home rather than work.   CW : 225  1 GW : 200  2 GW: 155  I will update you guys next Friday"	19-May-17
64313	Sertraline	"This is about my woman who is on zoloft......  Two years with my woman we never needed any lube. Now I&#039;m worried she is like a desert. Calmer now that her little zoloft friends in &quot;her head&quot; tell her to stay calm it&#039;s OK.  I&#039;ll keep you up to date with her &quot;progress&quot;  with her voices "	21-Sep-16
95754	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been on sertraline for almost a year now. On the 25mg I didn&#039;t notice any kind of difference. I was suffering from major depression, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts. My dr bumped me up to a 50mg dose &amp; have stayed here for about 8 months now. My girlfriend calls it my &quot;happy pills&quot; because when I forget to take a dose or two, everyone can tell."	23-Oct-14
71851	Tramadol	"after reading everyones experience with tramadol I feel better knowing it wasn&#039;t just me having withdrawals. H-codone couple days little stomach tightness no problem. Tramadol real sick feeling, now been 4 days without. starting to get better no bad stomach feeling did think I was getting the flu but sounds like everyone else trying to quit had the same symptoms. I have a script waiting for me at the pharmacy and that&#039;s where its staying. wasn&#039;t much help anyway."	4-Mar-16
128154	Phentermine	"Excellent experience so far, was on for 2 1/2 months and lost ~30 lbs.  Really HELPS you control your food intake.  You can push through and eat though, but its much much much easier to control yourself when you know you should stop eating but have that bottomless pit feeling in your stomach, or if you are just someone that eats when bored or emotional."	27-Apr-16
78420	Allegra	"Allegra has done the trick for me for years. My only disappointment is the expense of the 12-hour dosage now that my insurance company doesn&#039;t cover it anymore. It&#039;s a better deal to purchase the 24-hour dose but I don&#039;t like taking a higher dose of medication if it isn&#039;t necessary."	5-Aug-11
128774	Phentermine	"I start phentermine today. Read almost all reviews and I&#039;m excited to start taking it. Seems like it has everything I need. I will try it and come back in a month and let you all know how it has worked for me."	18-Feb-15
96368	Sertraline	"Zoloft worked wonders for me. I feel like a new and improved person. My social anxiety is almost totally gone and I feel much happier, able to enjoy life to the fullest.     Luckily, I have limited side effects: only vivid dreams (which is the most bothersome side effect) and occasional upset stomach, but nothing too bad. Of course all antidepressants have very different effects on everyone but it worked for me. I don&#039;t mean to sound like a commercial but I have really noticed a change and I feel much less anxious and depressed."	14-Feb-10
138406	Phentermine	"I started three weeks ago and down 13 pounds. 254 and now 241. Side effects ... Dry mouth, insomnia and heart racing not all the time. I will weigh myself again at the end of March."	20-Mar-14
97239	Ambien	"I took Ambien for a couple of nights, great drug, really works, slept like a baby deeply. Felt drugged the next day but I&#039;m very sensitive to these feelings. Then I decided to not take it again, and had &quot;rebound insomnia&quot; the first night, that was last night. Today I feel very tired after getting maybe 1 or 2 hours of sleep last night. I&#039;m going to try everything I know to get a good nights sleep tonight. Usually I do not need any sleep aids at all. Only took it recently because my sleep got messed up after a travel and being in a difficult place to sleep."	30-Jul-09
141878	Escitalopram	"I just started Lexapro a week and a half ago.  I noticed results almost immediately.  The only side effect I encountered was a slight light-headed feeling that has since subsided for the most part.  I have felt like hell and have been struggling with anxiety/depression for the past six years without medication.  This stuff has literally saved my life.  I feel like my old self again.  My only regret is that I didn&#039;t try it sooner."	16-Jun-10
138750	Phentermine	"I started Adipex two days ago. I&#039;m 21 years old 5&#039; tall and weigh 158lbs. According to my BMI and my doctors visit I am at the breaking point of obesity. I have had many struggles in the past with getting back to my goal weight of 105-110 and decided to give Adipex a shot. Obesity runs in my family and I hope to stop the cycle. I haven&#039;t had any side effects so far except for occasional dry mouth so I just drink water which is good anyway. I have had a great experience so far with increased energy and a suppressed appetite. I want to keep up with at least exercising for 30min a day and eating better and hopefully I will see results at the end of month one. I want to be at my goal weight which is a loss of about 50lbs in around 8 months. Wish me luck!"	12-Jan-13
141251	Escitalopram	"I have trouble taking meds and was scared to take escitralopram! Started on 10 mg and had it lowered to 5 mg until adjusting to it!! I want the full affect but don&#039;t know when to up the dosage! Still wake up anxious in mornings!"	7-Mar-15
71995	Tramadol	"I have been on prozac , Gabapentin and prozac for many years. I hve been on the same dose of tramadol for the last 6 years i take the  50 mg tablets . I take 2 pills 4 times a day. The thing about any medicine is how well  it works with our body chemistry. It lasts up to six hours. I&#039;m not a Zombie, I can take great care of my toddlers and as we all know toddlers drive u up the wall. I can still feel some of the pain but it&#039;s not bad enough to keep me unhappy and unproductive.OH AND if u become addicted to something , next time blame yourself for taking it wrong  instead of blaming the meds!!! Lol"	15-Oct-15
128054	Phentermine	"Hadnt weighed in years, went for a vasectomy march 5th 2016 and weighed 347 lbs. i was shocked. Started a diet that day and on june 5th had lost 27lbs to that point.

140557	Escitalopram	"Before taking this medication, I went into a time in my life where I would wake up every morning feeling anxious. My heart pounded very hard, I felt nauseous and puking would make me feel better. I felt alone, and didn&rsquo;t find care in my heart for other people like I had before. God has made me a loving and caring person. But my anxiety and/or depression, not 100 percent sure what it is, took over. I would look at people on the streets walking with smiles on their faces, and wonder&hellip; man&hellip; how can they be happy? Even when I see other people who look sad or down, it makes me feel worse. Like, the world is so messed up. I am unable to shine my light on others because of the anxiety I feel. I started taking escitalopram and my life has changed I can smile again"	3-Mar-17
141587	Escitalopram	"I have taken Lexapro 20 mg for many years for depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Only side effects (male) are unable to achieve orgasm, which can be frustrating if you let it. But, I tried Viibryd which was to &quot;improve&quot; Lexapro (no sexual side effects and no weight gain - which I never had weight gain anyway). Viibryd was awful. Did not help depression OR anxiety, and I was ravenously hungry. I insisted on going back on Lexapro. It is tried and true for me. Stick with it; it takes 6-8 weeks to be fully effective. "	7-Apr-13
138893	Phentermine	"Best weight loss ever and the easiest! Went from 192 to 138 in 4 months! I gained most if it back since they took it off the market 3 years ago!  Can&#039;t find anything nearly as good yet!"	1-Jan-10
96397	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been on Zoloft (generic) for about three months.  I noticed an immediate difference in the way I felt. I began taking it for mild anxiety/depression.  I am now starting to feel more depressed and empty again, like my body is becoming immune to it.  I don&#039;t want to switch because I don&#039;t want to go through another medication.  Zoloft though in general has helped incredibly within the last three months -- my boyfriend and I don&#039;t fight, I don&#039;t get snappy on people, and I feel so much better about going out and doing things. I am more productive now than I ever was. I just don&#039;t want my body to become used to it because I love the way it felt to feel okay."	17-Nov-09
96372	Sertraline	"I have been taking Zoloft 100mg for over a month now for my anxiety disorders and panic attacks that have gotten in the way of my peace  and my family welfare.  The results have been positive, I feel less stressful, less jittery and do not snap at my family for anything.  Also, it makes me feel more positive towards life and people.  At first it gave me mild diarrhea for two days, and yes, my sexual appetite has dwindle a bit.  I fully recommend it, it is worth trying some medication rather than living with emotional distress a whole life."	4-Feb-10
138950	Phentermine	"I started taking Adipex-P 37.5mg on April 1, 2009 and my starting weight was 210lbs. I went back after one month and lost 17lbs. I went back to my Doctor on July 30, 2009 and I weighed 168.5lbs which is a result of losing 41 1/2lbs! I am super excited and can&#039;t wait to lose more or at least to get to my goal of at least 135 to 140. The only one complaint I would have about it is the energy level totally disappears after your first or second week."	20-Aug-09
127660	Phentermine	"I am 46 years old and 4&#039;11&quot;.  On April 4th I was 165 pounds, borderline diabetic with high blood pressure at my Dr. visit.  He prescribed phentermine which I started taking on April 5th.  Today I had my 2 month visit and I have lost 19.8 pounds total.  My fasting blood sugar was down to 88 and my BP was down also.  Hoping to lose another 8-10 before my appointment in July.  Feeling great!!"	2-Jun-17
71902	Tramadol	"Kind of expensive for a so called pain med.  It actually feels like it heightened my pain level.   Makes my stomach hurt.  You&#039;re better off taking aspirin.   I&#039;m pretty sure tramadol should be thrown away."	15-Jan-16
64692	Sertraline	"I have been having depression and anxiety issues since 18 I&#039;m 28 right now. I have been on and off the drug. This drug is not perfect and  will never cure  depression or anxiety or other mental issues  , it just eliminate it  temporary, that&#039;s the time when we should work with therapy to find the real problem. I have been taking 50 mg. amazingly restored my interest in life, activities , interest in sex, no more depressing thoughts.  Simply it gave  me a 360 degrees to my mind. The beginning is always awful lots of change in thinking and  behaviour, no sex , sleepy, drowsy, I got sensitive face  skin  too. This drug is a godsend for me. After a month I started to, feel more awake, better sleep, great focus &amp; better sex. Always wait a month to stop."	18-Dec-15
141024	Escitalopram	"I was put on this for my panic disorder  because i was suffering from panic attacks  while driving because of a bad car wreck I had. Anyways my doctor put me on 10mgs when I took it in the day I was so drowsy and out of it I couldn&#039;t function. So I switched to taking it before bed and I would wake up every night with dizzy spells and heart beating out my chest. It would take a hour for those symptoms to go away and for me to continue my sleep. Then during the day I would have extreme anxiety I couldn&#039;t be behind the wheel of a car without panicking, I couldn&#039;t go out to the store without panicking I was only on it for 10 days the worst 10 days of my life and honestly I feel better now that I&#039;m off this horrible drug"	1-Dec-15
72082	Tramadol	"Suffer from fibromyalgia,two bulging disc, sciatica,restless leg syndrome. It usually takes me an hour or two to function in the morning. Have been on tramadol since it first became available.will continue to use this amazing medicine as long as my Dr prescribes it."	19-Mar-15
34169	Tramadol	"Ultram was prescribed for me for low back pain of unknown origin.  Unfortunately, I would say that the medicine only knocks the pain level 2 points on the 10 point scale. It allowed me to function, but did not take the pain away."	20-May-09
64544	Sertraline	"My family Doc put me on sertraline due to anxiety. For some unknown reason, I developed driving anxiety. I also had PSD. Initially, it was suppose to be a 9mos treatment. 25mg for 3 mos. After the 3mos, the dose was increased to 50mg. It worked great in reference to my PSD but there was only a 10% improvement on my driving anxiety. Right before the 9mos, I had some difficult family situations where I ended up self increasing the dose to 100mg. Eventually, i saw my Doctor in my nxt folllow up and he wasnt happy with me for increasing the dose...but ended up on prescribing the dose at 100mg. Now I have been on sertraline for 2 years and a few months and I feel that my driving anxiety is coming back and even worse."	24-Mar-16
64915	Sertraline	"I got put on this medication about 3 days ago and my first time taking it was in the morning. There are two side effects I&#039;ve had, the first day taking it I felt kinda nauseous and I threw up, but after that I was completely fine! I also have had a decreased appetite, but in my opinion that&#039;s a good thing, considering I want to lose a bit of weight. I was suffering for major depression, and got put on this medicine because I was caught in the middle of attempting suicide. But since I&#039;ve started this, I haven&#039;t had a single suicidal thought! I would definitely recommend this. Although ive been on it for just a few days, I already discover improvement."	31-Mar-15

138623	Phentermine	"I started Phentermine on 4/18/12. Starting weight at 170 lbs. I started taking it because having changed my diet and exercising, I could never lose weight. I have always had an athletic build, but after my third child, I could not lose the weight and gained more. So when I started phentermine, I changed my diet again, starting with a light breakfast such as oatmeal, one hour after I take the pill. Every few hours I have a light meal. And I exercise about 2 hours a day. Usually walk 2 miles and then an hour of weights. I just started my 4th week on phentermine and have lost 17 lbs. All phentermine is really doing is training me on how to eat properly again. Weight loss is about portion control and exercising."	10-May-12
141711	Escitalopram	"I have been depressed my whole life. A few gears ago I contracted HIV and that sent me over the edge. I lived in a personal hell for years and was hesitant to take an antidepressant. Within two days of taking it I was a totally different person. It was like my eyes had only seen black and white. My life is now full of color and I am so grateful that there are people out there that design medicines like this. I will never stop taking Lexapro. If you are depressed please give antidepressants a try. Don&#039;t wait for years to get help when it is available!"	7-Oct-11
71817	Tramadol	"I feel a need to give a personal warning against Tramadol. They are not kidding when they say it&rsquo;s a STRONG drug.     I had, to some degree still have, problems with bad general anxiety, and accompanying bad pains which were oddly un-located, sort of All Around. (I&rsquo;ve only recently learned that this is not unusual and doctors can&rsquo;t help apparently.) So I tried all kinds of different drugs from the Net. One which I felt made a difference was Tramadol. So I used it for several years, getting up to insane doses like six hundred mg daily, partly because it didn&rsquo;t *really* help overall but only suppressed the pain for some hours and then it came back worse."	16-May-16
138901	Phentermine	"I&#039;m 24, 5&#039;6, 167 lbs. I started taking phentermine 37.5mg at 8am and phendimetrazine 35mg at noon everyday in December 08. By March 09, 4 months later, I had lost 30 lbs- from 165-135lbs. Yes it was great, but I had 2 take a break from it. After 15 weeks I was experiencing heart palpitations (cardio workouts were challenging) severe dry mouth (to the point where the inside of my mouth was raw and bleeding) Keep hydrated! Just water will not work! This drug makes you urinate frequently. You need to replace lost electrolytes, use Gatorade. You must do weights, lunges etc because no exercise will result in the fat turning 2 flab. Hallucinations started as well. I was very energetic and insomnia set in. "	10-May-10
128701	Phentermine	"I started phen on 4\22\2015 with a starting weight of 226, I am a 5&#039;8  female with PCOS  trying to loose weight  for health and personal issues. As of 4\28\2015 my weight is  now 214. Honestly I am not sure if it&#039;s the pills doing or the combination of eating better,(totally cutting out carbs ,sugars) and exercising 3 days to 1 day off. But it&#039;s working and I&#039;m happy with the results The only thing I have noticed is dry mouth and heart palpitations. But I notice when I work out after taking the pill I don&#039;t notice them.  I have been experiencing  hunger pains as well.  I&#039;m only on the 15mg dose so maybe that&#039;s why it doesn&#039;t curb my appetite  like it&#039;s supposed to. Overall I&#039;m pleased and will continue to loose weight. End goal, 140"	28-Apr-15

128305	Phentermine	"Phentermine was just what I needed to help me lose the weight I needed to lose. I have high family risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, and stroke, so when my blood sugar showed that I was pre-diabetic at 168 lbs. My doctor put me on 1200-1500 calorie diet and phentermine. I&#039;ve always exercised three times a week. I lost 20 lbs. in three months and lost another 10 lbs. in the last year. At first I experienced side effects of dry mouth, trouble sleeping, and constipation by that subsided over time. I am still taking the medication, gong in for monthly weight and blood pressure checks, but lately have been feeling like it is losing its effectiveness. I&#039;m a little concerned about its addictive qualities and plan to ask my doctor about it."	2-Jan-16
127576	Phentermine	"Started out 392lb on 7/21/2017 and I&#039;m 6&#039;2. So far I don&#039;t think its doing a good job. I feel energetic but my appetite is still ferocious. Insomnia isn&#039;t a problem. Will update when I reach my first full week."	25-Jul-17
128209	Phentermine	"I started February 3rd of 2016, so I have been taking this medication for 5 weeks.  I am 21, 5&#039;2 and started at 259 lbs.   It has been five weeks, but I didn&#039;t take the medicine consistently or eat right during the third week due to a passing in the family.  I also haven&#039;t exercised at all due to the passing of my grandpa and I started my school semester when I first got the prescription. I do plan on adding exercise into my routine, but just by eating less and trying to eat better I have lost 26 lbs in a month and a half! I&#039;m at 233. I have went from a size 18 pants being TIGHT to a size 14 pants fitting perfectly. There is a noticeable difference and only side effects are headaches and dizziness, but after water and Tylenol I&#039;m fine! :)"	14-Mar-16
128031	Phentermine	"Hi everyone!!! I started taking Phentermine last Thursday, August 4, 2016.  My starting weight was 252 and today...seven days later I weigh 245.6 that&#039;s a loss of 6.4 pounds!!!  I work out 30 minutes a day doing mostly cardio and I do watch the little food that I do eat.  I have lots of energy and dry mouth but the water takes care of that.  I drink about 4 bottles a day.  My goal weight is 150 I really hope this helps me finally reach my sexy again! :)"	11-Aug-16
64317	Sertraline	"Worst medication I&#039;ve ever been prescribed for anxiety and depression. Took it for a little over a month (50 mg) with absolutely no change in symptoms. Absolutely not my doctors fault, she wanted to try something new to see if that would have a better affect on my mental health. Originally I was on Lexapro 20 mg and have since gone back to that. I feel like this really made my mental health worse and not better."	19-Sep-16
127648	Phentermine	"After taking this medication for about 6 months I lost over 75 lbs. Now I know everything comes at a price, I have high blood pressure now due to this medicine. Please think long before taking it."	9-Jun-17
72151	Tramadol	"I used to suffer from terrible restless legs syndrome, with countless sleepless nights. My doctor and I tried all sorts of medicine, from Sifrol/parkinson&#039;s medication, to valium, but none were very effective and/or had way too many side effects.    Then I started taking 100mg Tramadol and I haven&#039;t looked back since. I sleep well each and every night, wake up refreshed and my restless legs syndrome is totally eliminated. I&#039;m not having any side effects either.    This is a wonder drug for people with RLS. It really gives you your life back!"	11-Feb-15

95960	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been on this medication for 2 days and it has made me feel very low chills, dry mouth, suicidal thoughts, felt like I was going out my mind, I&#039;m scared to take anymore, they put me on straight 50mg so I think it might be to high amount, but I can say I feel less anxious."	29-Jun-13
64180	Sertraline	"I was prescribed this for anxiety and depression and can honestly say I wish I had never taken the first pill. I was told to take 50mg a day and after the first one I felt unwell with huge pupils and &#039;out of it&#039; but thought I&#039;d need to get used to the pill. After the second dose it was hell, no appetite, being sick, unable to keep anything down, a pounding headache that wouldn&#039;t stop, blurry vision, hot sweats, waking up every hour in the night, shaking and horrid thoughts. I contacted a pharmacist friend who said I had obviously got the worse end of the side effects and if I continued it might get better or stop and ride out what I was already feeling. I chose to stop, I thought this pill would solve my problem- it did not."	12-Mar-17
128662	Phentermine	"I began taking Phentermine 37.5mg on Jan 28 2015.  In addition I am doing a low carb/low calorie diet of 1000-1200 calories a day.  I walk two miles a day and do approximately 1 hour of cardio a day.  My doctor prescribed it for 2 months on and one month off. I am currently two weeks into my &quot;off&quot; month of phen. As of today, April 10 2015, I have lost 40 lbs.  I find it to be an excellent appetite suppressant.   The only side effect I experienced was vivid dreaming the first week.  Cigna doesn&#039;t cover the prescription but with the GoodRx discount I purchase a months supply at Kroger for $11.96.  The doctor co-pay is $25."	10-Apr-15
141088	Escitalopram	"I personally had a horrible experience with escitalopram. I was admitted to a hospital  because of a severe depressive episode. I was feeling that I was in a very dark place where everyone is going to abandon me, on top of depression I also felt extreme anxiety. It was my first time in the hospital for depression and I have never tried antidepressants before. They game me escitalopram (10mg) and abilify (1mg). For about an hour after taking the pills I felt more apathetic - which was better than I felt before but after one hour passed, I started to feel very nauseous and my heart rate increases, I felt that I was going to have a panic attack. For several hours I felt extreme fear, worse than before and I threw up several times."	19-Oct-15
64567	Sertraline	"Zoloft has given me the last leap I need to heal my mind. I have been struggling with severe anxiety, insomnia and bouts of depression for 3 years. While I have been off work into therapy and other means of rehabilitation, for the first time in years I actually feel calmer most the time, and mostly happy. I&#039;m so grateful. It&#039;s been trial and error and a slow process, but I know my self-care is my main priority now. See more of my story:mental-health-matters-a-womans-story-of-the-struggle. Good luck to all."	26-Feb-16
141141	Escitalopram	"I started 10mg lexapro 5 days ago for anxiety. I had been free from mirtazapine for about 9 days before starting. At first I though I had a tummy bug and stayed in bed the next day.... 5 days later and I&#039;m still in bed and yesterday spoke with my doc who said to stop taking them. I was a complete nervous wreck... more than I had ever been without meds. Neither of the previous 2 meds (paxtine and mirtazapine) had side effects like this. This med is not for me sadly."	6-Jul-15

63903	Sertraline	"I am 51and female. I have been on sertraline for 3 months and I love it.  I have not had or needed an alcoholic drink since I started on this med. I never thought I could give up my multiple glasses of red wine every night but, after taking a pill, I feel good for 24 hours at a time now instead of just for a few hours while drinking...and without the hangover or expense!  Also, my Blood pressure and pulse are MUCH LOWER now; My body no longer aches all over; I&#039;m not so nervous, agitated or angry anymore.  I no longer constantly think about death. I am satisfied with my job now, too, and no longer desire to quit.  I&#039;m also beginning to like myself. Side effects for me have mainly been: lack of appetite, some weight loss, and boring dreams."	12-Aug-17
34373	Tramadol	"New reports are claiming Ultram to be highly addictive - the FDA must have decided that the drug works to well and it is too cheap so they put out these reports.I have never felt  anything that would make me addicted except pain relief that enables me to perform my daily tasks.  People need to speak up quickly. My Doctor has decided he wants me to try Elavil which caused rapid weight gain and Cymbalta or Celebrex (very expensive - hmmm!) which caused sexual dysfunction and I felt like a zombie."	13-May-08
96149	Sertraline	"I love, love, love my Zoloft.  It&#039;s been a life-saver.  I&#039;m on 25 mg and I did have some insomnia and jitteriness for the first two weeks but that has subsided.  Doctor tried to &quot;up&quot; my doseage to 50mg but side effects came back and I was happy at 25mg so I went back down in dosage and I&#039;m content.  For the first time in my life I feel like I have some self-control and not constantly on the verge of a meltdown. I feel put back together and I can enjoy my family. I am a 35 year old female who works full time and have two children."	21-Oct-11
141515	Escitalopram	"I had extreme stomach pain within 1/2- 1 hour after taking Lexapro. I ended up in the hospital, dosage was 20mg.  I had taken Lexapro a few years ago with no side effects.  I have gained weight while on this. "	13-Jul-13
127804	Phentermine	"I started taking Phentermine in June of 2015.  By June of 2016 I had lost 100 pounds.  I stopped taking them in October of 2015 and gained about 5 pounds back.  I just recently started taking again today."	30-Jan-17
64518	Sertraline	"I moved out to Arizona 6 years ago. Since then I have had difficulty transitioning from the Midwest to the southwest. I struggled keeping a job and maintaining any relationships due to my depression and anxiety. I tried Prozac , but had to many highs and lows. After 5 years, I finally got relief. Doctor put me on Zoloft. Zoloft has been a miracle drug for me. I have maintained the same job for over a year and have been in a munogonus  relationship with my boyfriend. I sleep better and don&#039;t think so much. My family is so happy for me that i got the help i needed and we get along better. My thoughts would go into turmoil before and I would think the worst of everything then get stuck in a rut. It was hell."	11-May-16

I&#039;m under doctors care while taking these and she has me taking them for 2 months maybe 3. The only side effects for me is dry mouth and the first day taking them a little blurry vision only lasting 1 min. My appetite has completely vanished and its easy making the right food choices.  My goal weight is around 170.  I have a very positive outlook now that I can do this and will start exercising 3 days a week."	11-Aug-11
72304	Tramadol	"I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia as well as degenerative disc disease/arthritis in my cervical spine. I was given several different meds, eventually ending up with 50mg of tramadol. I recently had spinal fusion in my neck and have been in OxyContin/oxycodone and have had good post op pain relief, but little to no effect on my fibro symptoms. I&#039;ve been asking my doctor for tramadol for several weeks (I&#039;m 9 weeks post op) and he has said I wasn&#039;t ready for that weak a medication yet. Finally today he agreed to take me off of oxycodone and let me get back to tramadol for my main pain, which is fibromyalgia. It does not make me sleepy like oxycodone and it controls the pain in my legs/hips that just doesn&#039;t get relieved from oxy."	15-Oct-12
63804	Sertraline	"I have suffered from anxiety since I was in my teens, I&#039;m now in my 40&#039;s and have GAD.  I first started taking this medicine and it gave me really bad diarrhea and I stopped taking it but it was definitely helping with the panic attacks, I didn&#039;t have them at all!  I could feel one like it was about to come on but would go away just as quick.  I stopped taking it because of the diarrhea and tried others like lexapro which didn&#039;t do anything at all for me.  I was on 100mg sertraline and talked to my doctor about lowering my dosage to 25mg to start with so I don&#039;t experience the side effects so much, I&#039;m up to 50mg now and it&#039;s working great."	17-Oct-17
142076	Escitalopram	"I have been on 20mgs of Lexapro for about 2 months now. I love it! I went from crying everyday and wanting to kill myself to being a normal person. It also relieved some of my social anxiety. I would definetly recommend it."	27-Apr-08

140462	Escitalopram	"I have taken Lexapro for 3 years. Crippling episodes of OCD-generated anxiety and depression have been put to rest with Lexapro. I am taking 40mg/day, which is higher than typical 20 mg/day for depression. The OCD itself is essentially gone, and what&#039;s left of it (mixed rituals and obsessions) can be very easily controlled and does not scare me at all.  I have had no episode of major OCD/anxiety/depression for 3 years, which has never happened to before (I am 49). Lexapro, together with behavioral therapy, has saved my life. I am working a great job and enjoy my family life."	24-May-17
64083	Sertraline	"Years ago, I took Zoloft while going through chemo, and it helped me cope better. I wasn&#039;t crying as much. But, now you can only get generic, so I tired Sertraline for depression and panic attacks. It wiped me out. I could not keep my head up unless I had slept about 12 hrs each night.  When I tapered off, I began to experience some cognitive issues. My typing speed dropped, and my error rate went up. I&#039;d type things (words &amp; phrases) I didn&#039;t intend to, and not type things I intended to. A neurologist said the med was likely helping my serotonin levels, but, when I tapered off, my brain was having issues. Varied doses didn&#039;t help either problem, so I tapered off. Tiredness stopped quickly. Typing issue slowly improved over 2-2.5 months."	29-Mar-17
64234	Sertraline	"I was in therapy for two years for anxiety,my anxiety got so bad I couldn&#039;t drive hated traffic,basically didn&#039;t want to leave the house only for business,I was so scared to take medicine so I decided to go get on meds I had the bottle for two days before I took it finally last night I took it guess what I&#039;m fine no side effect .nothing!I worried for nothing so don&#039;t listen to all the negative stories try for yourself I&#039;m very new on it but I had to write this review for someone who may be as scared as I was .I was scared I even was going to go the emergency room and take it and I wasn&#039;t going to sign in I just thought I would feel safer if I sat there  to take it haha Im on zoloft 25 mg if your wondering  and I&#039;m so glad I gave  it a try!"	18-Nov-16
96304	Sertraline	"Day two and I&#039;m feeling a little weird but better than yesterday. I&#039;m on 50 mg to start. I&#039;ve been on Zoloft before and don&#039;t remember feeling like this. Last time I felt better almost instantly. I been off it for about 6 years. I&#039;ll stick with it this time because I know it does work."	31-Jul-10

140634	Escitalopram	"I had been on and off this drug for years and it significantly improved my depression and anxiety. It also helped me sleep (I took it at night because it made me nauseous). Unfortunately, it also contributed to weight gain, so I switched to Prozac and it made a big difference. On Zoloft now because Prozac gave me fog and I think it&#039;s my happy medium for now."	7-Dec-16

96426	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been taking 200mg Zoloft for the past 3 and 1/2 months (started 5 months ago) for (severe) depression and social anxiety disorder as well as other (less severe) conditions. I think this medicine is fairly effective for the long-term, but it was very hard for me to wait for it to &#039;kick in&#039; after several months of taking it. I cannot compare this medication to other antidepressants, but it was pretty good; it was also much more effective (for me)."	18-Nov-10
127679	Phentermine	"Use with caution! I was stupid enough to take a whole pill and I thought I was going to die. My heart was racing even though I was laying perfectly still and the world was swimming like I was drunk. The effects have lessened over the course of a few hours but I will definitely not take more than 1/4 of one of theses pills in the future!"	12-Apr-17
64545	Sertraline	"I suffered terrible depression and anxiety after I had my son. It was the worst experience because I had no control over the worrying, sadness and hopelessness. I wasn&#039;t able to enjoy my newborn because I felt so down and anxious about everything. After I developed insomnia and would sleep for 3 days at a time I decided to get help. I felt embarrassed and shameful for feeling this way, but I can assure anyone dealing with postpartum anxiety/depression that it&#039;s NOT your fault! It&#039;s a very real disorder and can take a person&#039;s life if they don&#039;t seem help. Zoloft literally saved mine, I have been on 100mgs for one year and feel like the happy person I was before pregnancy. Best decision I&#039;ve ever made!!"	22-Mar-16
141932	Escitalopram	"I found that Lexapro really elevated my mood drastically and helped my anxiety, but it also gave me severe insomnia, dreamy thinking, and the inability to pay attention."	3-Dec-09

141083	Escitalopram	"I was having a lot of anxiety over trying to raise my RAD (Reactive attachment disorder) niece.  I didn&#039;t feel depressed just anxious and had panic attacks. Her and I were in a power struggle. This med helped me relax and pick my battles and not get over zealous about thing. The bad thing is within 5 months I gained 15 pounds not changing my eating habits at all. The 6th month I tried to lose weight and could not so I went back and got on something else."	23-Oct-15
141665	Escitalopram	"Lexapro saved my life. I have been on this medicine for about 7 weeks now.  At first, I was hesitant because I have tried them all--Effexor (constantly exhausted and edgy), Paxil (worked great for anxiety but had horrible sexual side effects and brain zap feelings), Zoloft (didn&#039;t help), Celexa (helped a little but Lexapro is definitely better for me).  Finally I found one I can rely on! The first week my anxiety got worse, which my doctor warned me of.  Luckily I had Xanax to get me through the first couple weeks. But now, I find myself not needing the Xanax at all anymore. I haven&#039;t had a panic attack since the 2nd week I started this medicine, and I am loving life! Thank you Lexapro."	24-Jun-12
141308	Escitalopram	"I dealt with anxiety and depression for several years. I had high social anxiety, and pleasure in isolation and darkness. I started on one SSRI but the side effects turned me into another person completely, I experienced emotional, spiritual, and creative numbness, weight gain, and overconfidence. So I got off of it because I wasn&#039;t myself anymore. So I tapered off of that and then I got on Lexapro and it immediately took care of my depressive symptoms and anxiety. I bumped up to 20mg after a couple of months and I am perfectly back to normal. I feel like myself. No side effects at all! I highly recommend Lexapro. Just be patient and wait it out."	27-Nov-14
64030	Sertraline	"I have been reading reviews for days on many different meds for anxiety. I was put on Effexor and I read reviews and possible side effects and I became too afraid to take it. So I recently spoke to a friend who has been on Zoloft for 2 months and has great results. So today I&#039;m starting 25mg and bumping it up to 50mg in a week. For years I have suffered with anxiety. But over the last couple months I have had 2 panic attacks, 1 of them actually put me in the hospital. The one I had last night I was able to talk myself out of it after about an hour. Now I feel like I&#039;m always waiting for it to happen again. Which causes anxiety.  I&#039;m very afraid of taking meds in fear of side affects. But after last night I&#039;m just gonna do it."	23-Feb-17
141872	Escitalopram	"I suffered from anxiety for many years and as I got older it became horrible. Palpitations and things that do not seem to bother others would destroy me on the inside. I began taking Lexapro 10mg. At first it did help but then I started to have long lasting headaches...sensitive to light and feeling that I was &quot;numb&quot; from the neck up. I completely shut out the outside and withdrew from 90% of everything I liked. I read all of the reviews about the medicine as far a getting off of it, and I felt that it was pushing me further into a hole. I decided to take it every other day for one week, then half the dose and half the days. My advice is drink lots of water/ Fish oil every other day/ You must walk/ Eat even if you must force yourself/Sleep at night."	20-Jul-10
72064	Tramadol	"I have been on tramadol for for years first giving to me for pain. It is an incredible pain medicine that gives me so much energy and makes my anxiety and occasional depression non existent, however, I have tried so many times to get off because I am now completely addicted. When I want to get off, even taper down enough to get off, I get the most horrible lightening zapping going thru my brain along with other withdrawals. It is an incredible drug for pain and depression BUT be careful if u stay on for a long period of time u will become a prisoner just like any other pain, depression medicine and the withdrawals are ugly."	23-Apr-15

I had a big burst of energy the first day I took Adipex, but could not sleep that night.  The next day I did not have any side effects or burst of energy.

71839	Tramadol	"I was prescribed tramadol for the arthritis pain in my hands. I had no relief from pain so I used aleve or ibuprofen which worked slightly better. I&#039;ve read how some people have a significant reduction in pain when using this drug but I actually asked my doctor if it was a joke. I don&#039;t think it takes the pain away so much as it effects your thinking...."	31-Mar-16
71908	Tramadol	"Tremolo did nothing for me.  Norco was very much more effective"	6-Jan-16
128456	Phentermine	"When I 1st heard of this pill I went straight to Google to see peoples experience ....which everyone was saying how much weight they lost so I had to try for myself ! I&#039;m 5&#039;2 n weighed 160 ! The 1st day I took it I was shocked on how high it made me feel. I had no trouble sleeping no bad side affects . After 6 days on pill I went from a size 10 to 8. I dropped 9 pounds. I just weighed myself and I&#039;m down to 146 and it hasn&#039;t even been 2 weeks. Yes this pill works but if u want to loose weight don&#039;t skip pills. Trust me its worth it. Good luck to y&#039;all !!"	28-Sep-15
96011	Sertraline	"I have been on sertraline for 6 months now. In the beginning I experienced delayed ejaculation, followed by nausea, extreme dizziness and exhaustion. For three days I was on bed with these symptoms. Later condition improved and I felt better. But now I have body pain with continued dose."	29-Nov-12
141912	Escitalopram	"Its a great medication other than the side effect of weight gain!"	1-Mar-10
141899	Escitalopram	"I had been trying to convince my boyfriend of 6 years to go to the doctor and get something prescribed to treat his panic attacks, GAD, etc. At the beginning of last year he finally went to the doctor after enduring panic and anxiety for 5 or 6 years. The doctor prescribed him Xanax which helped a lot but he still was unable to do a lot of things. Today is his seventh day using Lexapro and I am already beginning to see a difference in him. The first 4 days he had some pretty shocking side effects, i.e. dry mouth, nausea, bit of dizziness and unable to reach orgasm. However judging by how well he is doing on day 7, I have very high hopes for this medicine and am excited that he is finally going to get to really enjoy life the way he deserves."	11-Apr-10
141858	Escitalopram	"I have been taking Lexapro for over a year. Have gone from 10mg per day to 20mg per day. Switched between taking in the morning and taking at night. It has done nothing for me. I still have anger episodes, still worry constantly, and still big ups and downs. Hope to find something that helps soon. Good luck to all who are trying also."	30-Aug-10
141436	Escitalopram	"I love Lexapro! It helps me stop drinking, lose weight and I have way less anxiety now. For all those people that have sexual dysfunction, try taking it at night right before bed, after sex. I have no problems in that area now!"	19-Dec-13
96255	Sertraline	"I tried it and had a big attack. But I guess that&#039;s normal when you have anxiety. I read some of these comments and decided to give it another try. Lets see what happens. "	1-Mar-12
161242	Allegra Allergy	"I had my mother taking this for her allergies.  It did nothing for her.  After taking for almost 3 weeks, she broke out in hives.  We stopped immediately.  Went back to Clariten"	11-Apr-16
96317	Sertraline	"Stick with the medicine, it truly does take 6-8 weeks for your body to adjust. I take 75mg in the morning (keeps me up at night with RLS) and my anxiety is under control and I am able to go on with life and my day to day activities. The side effects I had in the beginning of being tired, RLS, yawning excessively...did go away with time and now I experience none of those things."	15-Jun-10
64041	Sertraline	"Took Zoloft for depression and anxiety and was on it for about six months. It absolutely helped and I felt less anxious almost immediately. But I stopped taking it due to increasing negative side effects. I have learned through my journey that other people&#039;s experiences of these kinds of meds are no real indication of how it will be for you personally. But sometimes it helps to share. Just take everything with a grain of salt.  Zoloft negatives: constant yawning, first three days you feel so unwell you think you&#039;ll never be ok again.  Also, inability to have an orgasm, which lasted about three months and then I was fine. Serious vertigo that got so bad I had to stop taking it.  Tried venlafaxine and Prozac with better results."	13-Feb-17
139123	Phentermine	"I&#039;ve been taking Phentermine for 2 weeks. For about one month before that I was taking Bontril (Phendimetrazine). I liked the Bontril but it didn&#039;t curb my appetite as well as Phentermine does. I try to stick to 1100 cals/day but I do some calorie cycling now and that way I&#039;ll go above 1100 so my body doesn&#039;t think it&#039;s being starved long-term. I hope that will help prevent a rapid gain when I go off the medicines.    Since starting these various medications I&#039;ve lost about 11 pounds (from 200 to 189 as of this morning). The Tanita scale at the clinic indicates that my water composition has remained about the same while fat percentage has decreased and muscle mass has increased. And I&#039;m not even exercising, so that&#039;s pretty cool."	2-Dec-08
128823	Phentermine	"I started Adipex-P nine months ago and I&#039;ve consistently lost weight. When I weighed in at the Dr.s today, I am down 20.6lbs since last month! I&#039;ve lost a total of 83lbs and was approved for my left knee replacement on Nov 18. When that heals, we do the other one. I have battled obesity my whole life- had gastroplasty (stomach stapling) back in the early 80s and I&#039;ve lost and gained hundred pounds during  time periods in my life and I&#039;ve got hope now that there may be a light at the end of the Tunnel.  When I get my knee joints in and get active I think I really might be able to get down to a decent weight and make it stick. I&#039;d like a second chance at life, to find a wife to spend my retirement years with. Staying Positive!"	15-Oct-14
95844	Sertraline	"Before I started taking Zoloft for depression and anxiety I was also suffering from insomnia. Was taking Ambien and Valium to help but the Ambien was not really helping my insomnia. Maybe get 3 hrs of sleep or 5hrs on a good night. Suffered from panic and anxiety attacks. Went to therapy and after some time Dr Recommended Zoloft. Was hesitant at first but could not live like this anymore so I started taking it about a year ago. Zoloft is the best thing I could have done. The first week or too I had side effects. But soon after depression lifted anxiety gone. I sleep great now."	11-Dec-13
128409	Phentermine	"i recently went to see a doctor for weight loss! Before I even had a minute to fill out my paper on my history, he asks me what kind of pills I want? I was like (huh?), then he explained about adipex, when I say explained, all he said was take it once a day, diet , come see me in 30 days! I thought this was crazy, he told me to bring back my paper work Monday! ANYWAY, I took it as he prescribed one a day, for only two days and have to stop! I am a recovering alcoholic /addict, this crap gave me the exact same feeling as meth, in which I have not used in 15 years. I was high!! I cannot jeopardize my sobriety so I guess I&#039;ll stay fat! But this doctor maybe should have took 5 minutes with me to explain or ask something about me!"	13-Sep-15
71923	Tramadol	"I&#039;m allergic to codeine and NSAIDs rip my stomach apart and cause GI bleeding so this is what I take for pain. tramadol 50 mg two or three/day. I broke my foot recently and was literally screaming in pain. Took Diclofenac, tylenol, no relief. Took 100 mg tramadol and feel much better now. I had to get off Prozac to take this but I&#039;m glad I did. Prozac made me eat all the time, I put on 20 lbs. tramadol actually suppresses my appetite which is a plus. If you take this longer then a few months make sure to taper off."	6-Dec-15
96048	Sertraline	"Have been taking 100mg for more than 2 years. It works but I am not fully fine. Thinking of increasing the dose to 200mg."	9-Jan-13
96417	Sertraline	"It has been a great medicine to help with my anxiety.  I feel much calmer and more in control of my circumstances.  I have, however, also had the sexual side effects of a lower libido and difficulty with ejaculation"	30-Dec-10
64611	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been suffering from manic depression and anxiety since I was a teenager. I came to my breaking point last month and finally sought professional help. I&#039;m now on day 3 with taking Zoloft 25mg twice daily and I&#039;ve noticed some difference already and it&#039;s for the better.  I&#039;m not really experiencing the side effects everyone is talking about and I&#039;m sleeping just fine. I was a little sleepy the first day and body was a little sore but nothing like everyone is describing. I know its  only been day 3 so its not really in my system. So I&#039;ll check in in a few weeks. Wish me luck"	14-Feb-16
34137	Tramadol	"This does not take the pain away."	21-Jul-09
96299	Sertraline	"I started taking Zoloft 50mg for 2 days now and really felt no change yet. My Doctor said it could take up to 6 weeks to get the full effect. Think I had an anxiety attack the other day at work. Blood pressure was up, nervous, sweating, throwing up.  "	29-Aug-10
96318	Sertraline	"Withoug Zoloft I would probably be dead or killed.  I have been taking Zoloft for 19 years.  Since my daughter was born the doctors have tried to take me off, but the depression started again.  I did counseling and reduced the dose, but to be completely off makes me mean.  I snap at people, easily irritated, road rage, body feels like it will explode with anxiety.  It has never effected my sex drive.  No weight gain can be blamed on Zoloft, probably feeling more sociable and going out to eat has caused a little weight gain. No headaches. Thanks for reading and I hope I helped.  "	9-Jun-10
95983	Sertraline	"2 mths in now and I find it hard to put into words the difference Sertraline has made to my life.  I realised last night I actually felt happy - I can&#039;t remember the last time that thought went through my brain.  Obsessive negative thoughts just aren&#039;t there. I feel mostly calm and far far less anxious.  Enjoying life again for the first time in YEARS!"	12-Apr-13
140990	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve been on lexapro for about 8 months now. It&#039;s been so good for me! I am 24 and female. I am no longer depressed. Before I first started, I was waking up every morning with suicidal thoughts. Now all of those thoughts are gone! I am so much more social! I can talk to anyone without anxiety, and I actually want to talk to people! I have more energy and have the urge to excercize and cook myself meals. These are things I wanted to do before but depression kept me in my bed feeling hopeless. There&#039;s hope! Depression is real. Don&#039;t feel weak for taking antidepressants. It can be the first step to getting out of bed and living your life how you want to live it!"	14-Mar-16
71764	Tramadol	"This med works better than other pain meds. Knee pain was so bad from implants I was considering getting back on my crutches. No crutches needed and gained back a little energy."	15-Jan-17
119796	Ambien CR	"I&#039;ve tried several different sleep medications for insomnia and while attempting to get used to the CPAP machine for sleep apnea. Ambien CR works great, I can get a full nights sleep, however go to bed within 1 hour of taking the medication or you will feel a bit drugged. I don&#039;t recommend taking every night, it is addictive (try not to take more than 3 nights in a row). It is more difficult to wean off from than regular Ambien. Overall, if needed this is a good medication if taken responsibly."	5-May-09
71628	Tramadol	"I been taking tramadol every four months to get a break from Lortab.  Been on Lortab for about 8 years, I&#039;m not addicted to it because I can stop anytime without any detox issues.  I have 2 knee replacements,  rod in my right femor, lower back fusion. I&#039;m only 54 yrs old.  So I need these meds.  Tramadol doesn&#039;t take my chronic pain half away, but it allows me to move around."	29-Oct-17
141611	Escitalopram	"Having started a business in a high stress field, I experienced episodes of stress and anxiety that interfered with my sleep, ability to concentrate and that began to manifest physically with chest pains, headaches, etc.  The first 10 days were a nightmare.  I had a terrible spike in my anxiety and stress levels.  I considered bailing on the medication and even my business, but my wife pressed me to continue.  After 10 days I started to see an improvement.  The anxiety improved and so did my mood.  By day 14 or so I was transformed.  I completely stopped having anxious thoughts.  My entire demeanor changed.  I am now like Teflon- stress does not stick around for more than a few minutes.  This medicine was a lifesaver and my business is great."	8-Feb-13
64570	Sertraline	"I have manic depression and anxiety. I was moved to 100mg quite soon after starting it. I got used to 50mg after a week or two. I haven&#039;t been suicidal much since the start. They have been really effective.  My side effects have been drowsiness. It used to help with my nightmares but not so much anymore. At first I was extremely thirsty now it&#039;s not as bad. I used to get lesions of dry skin everywhere which was so upsetting. But it&#039;s gone now. I had itchy skin. But overall its been helpful."	24-Feb-16
140797	Escitalopram	"I was prescribed this drug for major depression and C-PTSD. I only took it for one week, 5mg. It was awful. I was exhausted all of the time, had trouble falling asleep and my sleep was disturbed by very vivid and bizarre dreams. I woke up every morning shaking, dizzy and disoriented. During the day my legs hurt so bad it made walking difficult. It made me so hungry, craving carbs, I gained 9lbs of belly fat in one week! It left me with zero motivation and unable to feel any joy, excitement, pleasure. I felt detached, empty, I felt dead. I stopped taking it and while i&#039;m still struggling with depression I do feel like me again, I feel alive and have lost all of the weight gained while taking it."	26-Jun-16
128121	Phentermine	"Lost 30 lbs in 3 months still taking it want to lose another 20 lbs worst side effect was dry mouth"	20-May-16
140422	Escitalopram	"I started Lexapro for lifelong depression and anxiety, which at times has been quite severe. I have tried probably about 3/4 of all your typical SSRI and SNRI drugs. Some were kind of helpful, some helped a little while then stopped, some made things worse. Lexapro has saved my life. I have been on it about seven months now and feel better than expected. I am not overwhelmed as soon as I wake up, which was a huge reason I slept all the time. I generally feel positive most of the time. One added effect I was not expecting was my concentration, focus and memory seemed to improve. My social anxiety has improved significantly, which was a huge issue for me. This helped me. Keep searching til you find the right med FOR YOU"	6-Jul-17
65017	Sertraline	"Lately I&#039;ve been having really bad panic attacks, migraines, night terrors/nightmares every night for three weeks I started Zoloft last night and it already started working within a night I&#039;m more calm and feel like my old self already."	28-Jan-15
127767	Phentermine	"Today was my 1st day taking to pill. I had energy for about 12 hours and really no urge to eat although I did. I drank plenty of water today, I felt like I had dry mouth. No real bad side effects. I did work out and it help."	9-Feb-17
96056	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been taking Zoloft for just over four weeks and it&#039;s effects have been dramatic. I was initially prescribed 50mg, which was way too high of a starting dose for an individual with panic disorder. The first few days were awful, as I experienced a dramatic increase in anxiety and feelings of intense dread. I was dropped down to 25mg and given a prescription of Klonopin to hold me through the titration period. I am currently taking 75mg and have noticed a marked improvement in my condition over the past few days. Overall anxiety is significantly decreased, below levels prior to the development of my panic disorder. CBT has been very effective as well in developing a healthier relationship with my anxiety."	11-Dec-12
141356	Escitalopram	"On 5mg Escitalopram, I initially experienced an almost euphoric-like state with 0% anxiety. I was motivated, talking/laughing more, getting things done. The anxiety began to creep back after 2 weeks though and the extreme happiness leveled off. I increased the dosage (to the prescribed 10mg) which I&#039;ve stayed on for several weeks and now I have mild depression with lingering anxiety.  Suicidal thoughts are completely gone. After consulting with my doctor I may increase the dosage. Side effects: irregular bowel movements (resolved), excessive gas, sleepiness, tense/tight muscles and less intense orgasms. Out of the all the antidepressants I&#039;ve been on, this is the better option and I&#039;m grateful for this medication."	1-Nov-14
128421	Phentermine	"I was on Phentermine 3 Years ago and lost 150lbs in a year and a half.  I worked out and because it curbs your appetite I could eat healthier.  You really need to work out and use it as a tool to help you with your new lifestyle because if you don&#039;t the weight WILL come back on plus more.  I kept it off for 3 years but then had a job change that kept me from going to the gym in the morning &amp; afternoons and didn&#039;t work out with the kids. I gained 150 lbs back in 3 years.  I just started again on 08/12 and have lost 25lbs. I haven&#039;t got into a steady gym routine now but it&#039;s motivated me to go to the gym in the afternoons.  I chose a different center for the gym because my kids can play basketball or swim while I work out."	3-Sep-15
64148	Sertraline	"Hi all I&#039;ve started this medication about six weeks ago after 9 years on Venlafaxine 75mg, the Venlafaxine had terrible side effects if you missed one tablet boy did it remind you.   The first few days on Sirtraline seemed ok but then followed sickness and stomach pains and severe anxiety. I&#039;ve just upped my dose to 100mg two days ago and feel like hell, racing thoughts, anxiety, on edge, just want to shut myself away but can&#039;t because of my job and kids, it&#039;s truly heartbreaking.   My doctor doesn&#039;t know I&#039;ve upped my dose I needed to act as could feel myself crashing. I&#039;ve had CBT and that was great whilst you have the treatment but then all that support just stopps and your going it alone again.   I just hope this will start working soon."	22-Jan-17
127537	Phentermine	"Hi!  When my Dr put me on this I was upset with my weight I have a lot of health problems the number 1# of them is rheumatoid arthritis I have had it for little over 13 year&#039;s and I&#039;m just 36 it has took over my life I can&#039;t get out and do much so for over the past five years I have picked up A LOT of weight and it has drove me insane June 5th 2018 at 277lb I get the pill one a day go back July 5th at 264lb gives me for this month 2 a day so August 4th at 246lb down 31 pound&#039;s Love it no problem with it Other then DRY mouth I&#039;m still on it 2 a day"	7-Aug-17

Some days I&#039;m still hungry though. It hasn&#039;t even been a month and today I weigh 224. That&#039;s 26 pounds in 27 days almost a pound a day with no exercise.

139132	Phentermine	"I&#039;ve been on Phentermine for 3 weeks now. I started off weighing 231 lbs. Now, I&#039;m down to 214 lbs. I&#039;ve not experienced the side effects reported. I have an active job which zaps my energy, which may be why my sleeping habits have not changed. However, I can say that I&#039;ve been more productive at work, and on the weekends, I have about a 2 mile jog&#039;s worth of energy to burn."	5-Nov-08
128071	Phentermine	"I started Phentermine 37.5 on Sunday June 19th 2016 as prescribed by my dr. I take 1 pill 20 mins before my breakfast. So far no side effects at all, took my 3rd dose today.

71919	Tramadol	"My doctor switched me to Tramadol after Tylenol 3 started losing effectiveness. I was on Ty 3 for years, after four lumbar surgeries, two fusions, continued pain...  taking 3-4, 50 mg. Tramadol/day, trying to keep it at three. Not pain free, but at least bearable. Unless/until it wears off.   I have joint pain, my elbows hurt. OW. Pretty sure it&#039;s caused by the drug, but right now, dealing with it."	11-Dec-15

The only side effects I&#039;ve had are mild dizziness, and hard to sleep before 11pm even tho I take it as early as 7am. My cravings are completely gone! But, i haven&#039;t lost any weight!  The energy feeling comes and goes, ive actually taken a nap once.. I&#039;ll try to keep my updates current."	22-Aug-16
127524	Phentermine	"I just started taking this pill today. I ate breakfast and drank 24oz of water before I took this pill. I didn&#039;t want to feel sick and have any side effects because I didn&#039;t eat first. I didn&#039;t not exercise today or eat good, I wanted to see how the pill made me feel before I start eating good and exercising ( which I will do tomorrow). I am early 20s 5&quot;2 SW: 169.4lbs; GW: 130lbs - 120lbs. I have been over weight for 7 years since having my daughter. It&#039;s time I get my body back.

I gave it 5 star cause it Day 1. I will update in about 2 weeks!"	16-Aug-17
128578	Phentermine	"I&#039;m 24 years old and was at 291.2 pounds... about 9 pounds away from 300 pounds!! I knew right then I had to make a change. A friend told me about phetermine and I wanted to try it. I saw a doctor and I was prescribed it 37.5mg. I was also on a 1200 calorie diet.  I started in May 2015 and I checked in on June 2nd and LOST a total of 17.2lbs so far.  I Love it.  I now currently weigh 274.  My goal weight is 160!....I walk 3 days a week about 2 or 3 miles  a day and drink lots of water.  This works and I&#039;ve never felt better"	6-Jun-15
139003	Phentermine	"I was in a bad car accident about a year ago and now have 15 pieces of implanted metal in my right leg.  Because of the strain to my body, my doctors encouraged me to lose weight.  I was going to the gym, staying under 1400 calories and going to physical therapy. I didn&#039;t drop a single pound.  I&#039;ve been on the phentermine for 2 and a half months, and I&#039;ve already lost an AMAZING 60 pounds...40 more, and I&#039;ll be where I was supposed to be. I just got my refill and can&#039;t wait to see what happens in the next 3 months."	11-Jul-09
96237	Sertraline	"This medicine has been a life saver. I was to the point where I thought I&#039;d be in a constant state of panic (heart palpitations, increased blood pressure, hyperventilating). My symptoms initially got more intense once I started Zoloft, but after about 3-4 weeks I started to normalize.   I started at 25mg daily, which helped side effects, and gradually worked my way up to 50 mg. I found taking 25mg in the morning and 25 mg at night helped keep the side effects to a minimum.   After 2.5 months on Zoloft, I no longer need Xanax and my blood pressure has decreased dramatically. Whatever you do, don&#039;t hold up in your house while starting this medication. Get out and about, put yourself in uncomfortable situations."	8-Apr-12
141096	Escitalopram	"After two and a half months of constantly being &quot;down in the hole&quot;, my mood is finally starting to improve. I went from 10 to 20mg and it finally started working. Don&#039;t give up!"	22-Aug-15
64913	Sertraline	"Zoloft (Sertraline) is an SDRI which was prescribed to me for Social Anxiety and Depression. I am currently at 200mg, although I started at 25mg and was eventually risen to my current dose. This was not rapid, as it actually took three months before I reached my current dose due to an insufficient response to lower doses.    In my experience, this medication managed to ease my depression - from severe to mild and persistent to occasional, also this effect was notable at only 75mg. Social Anxiety was slightly more troublesome, not responding to lower doses although I eventually, after three months, began to notice a slight change in the severity of my SAnD when I reached 150mg. I am currently noticing changes, although quite slowly."	1-Apr-15
140732	Escitalopram	"I have had panic attacks for years after trying many other a it depressants that made this worse Lexapro was my magic pill I have had a 90% reduction in acute panic disorder and general anxiety, with this drug I&#039;m normal person again and I have my life back.  I&#039;m my opinion this is a blockbuster drug and I&#039;m so thankful to the chemist that created it.  Thank you for giving me my life back!  &lt;3"	4-Aug-16
139047	Phentermine	"I have been on Adipex for 3 weeks now and the only changes I have noticed in me and my body is that I have horrible cotton mouth and I am extremely constipated. I have maybe lost 1 lb since I started taking this medicine. I am extremely disappointed in this medicine it has done nothing for me."	18-Apr-09

Im always on my feet I work 3 jobs. In the month that I have taken them, not once have I not been able to fall asleep, I have felt pretty moody though.If I dont take it I wake up with a pounding head ech."	2-Mar-08
64977	Sertraline	"I started having panic attacks regularly. I couldn&#039;t be on my own, I was afraid of choking every time I ate. It was awful. I lost about 25 pounds in a very short amount of time and couldn&#039;t get any of my school work done without suffering from anxiety. I was diagnosed with panic disorder and began taking a variety of medications--eventually I was prescribed Zoloft. It took about a month to kick in but ever since then I have not had a full blown panic attack (although I occasionally suffer from bouts of anxiety). For the most part I would say I seem to suffer from very few side effects--I would say I am more lethargic than normal,  sometimes I have trouble falling asleep at night, and I have a decreased sex drive. But no more panic attacks!"	12-Jan-15
64057	Sertraline	"I feel very difficult when taking Zoloft at 25mg. for about ten days then 50mg. afterwards. I primarily take it for stress, anxiety, and depression.  Once I was told by a psychiatrist that I could have PMDD even though I haven&#039;t been diagnosed with the condition by a gynecologist, it&#039;s because I would have severe crying spells days before my period so severe that I wouldn&#039;t stop crying, and I would feel extremely sensitive emotionally.  I still cry a little before I get period sometimes, but the medication I take seems to work well to keep my nerves calm.  In addition I have bipolar depression, PTSD, social anxiety, and ADD/ADHD.  Ritalin is another medication that I also take."	2-Feb-17

64292	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been on this for a few months now, prozac made me 100x worse and an awful relationship made me 1000x worse. So I started on this. Same as any tablets, horrible initial few weeks but then got better. Dry mouth, bad night mares and eating like a horse. But it all depends what time you take this tablet. I&#039;m on 50mg, I started off breaking the Tablet in 2 and taking a half a day. It&#039;s ok, all depends on you though. I have to come off it for a while as I have a drugs test for work and this is known to cause a failed drugs test. So keep that in mind. Other than that, it&#039;s good. I&#039;m much more happy, and less scared. Feel positive which is a nice change."	28-Oct-16
139050	Phentermine	"I started using Phentermine 37.5 just two days ago and I love it. I started at 5&#039;6&quot;, 224lbs. This morning I weighed myself and I&#039;m already down to 219lbs. I am hoping to lose about 50-70 pounds at least. I do get the dry mouth that others have said, but I don&#039;t have the energy boost, I do however have to pee like every 30-60 minutes I think it&#039;s because of the amount of water I&#039;m drinking now."	19-Jun-09
72395	Tramadol	"I received Tramadol as a treatment for my back pain. Unlike Vicodin, Oxycontin, Morphine, and Methadone, Tramadol seems to have minimal side-effects. It makes me energetic and able to get through the day pain-free. Plus, I sleep well at night. I was addicted to the above narcotics for a few years, and Tramadol is the only drug that makes me feel pain-free, but also gives me the confidence that it is less addictive and less expensive."	8-Jan-11
127678	Phentermine	"Hi , I&#039;m 40. 5-11 290 male when starting phentermine 37.5 mg. I figured I better post and help someone maybe not go through what I went through the 1st three days . Take on full stomach !!!!! I took this med on semi empty stomach the first 2 days and I thought I was going to come out of my skin it was horrible horrible feeling like I never felt !!!  I stopped my dose after day 2 and didn&#039;t wear off for another full day and slept 1hr in those 3 days !!!!! So day 4 I tried on a full stomach and no probs just the normal bad cotton mouth . I work swing shifts so I learned if your going to take this med take it as if it&#039;s not going to wear off for 16hrs. If you do this you&#039;ll be able to sleep if not good luck lol. lost 18 pounds this month"	13-Apr-17
96241	Sertraline	"I was on Zoloft for two years. I started taking it after I had a panic attack due to extreme stress. It worked well for me. I tried Lexapro for a few days maybe 9 to be exact and I couldn&#039;t function. I couldn&#039;t lift my head or have the strength to care for my son who was a baby at the time. Zoloft was amazing. I stayed on 50mg and felt normal again. But with that said, I did gain 30 pounds. The medicine makes you feel so relaxed as before I was a calorie counter and obsessed with what I ate. I didn&#039;t mind much because I was better, that&#039;s what mattered. I came off of it and decided to get back on 5 months after stopping. I can say the second time around of being on it doesn&#039;t work for me. Like others, I must have become immune to it."	21-Mar-12
128168	Phentermine	"I began taking phentermine three days ago. The only side effect I have experienced has been dry mouth. Biotene mouthwash and mouth spray have helped along with lots of water. My appetite is suppressed greatly, which is wonderful. My biggest issue has been snacking late at night. My nights have not been filled with thoughts of restaurants and gourmet meals. I&#039;m not much of a sweets eater; I love good cooking. I didn&#039;t even crave anything for the past couple of nights. It&#039;s been two days, and I&#039;m down three pounds already. I weighed in at Weight Watchers today, and I&#039;m exactly 270 today. I&#039;ll update in a week. Feeling excited!"	16-Apr-16
119772	Ambien CR	"Ambien has been hit or miss for me. When it works it&#039;s bliss! 2 out of 3 days it doesn&#039;t work well. The CR is supposed to help me stay asleep but at best I get 4-6 hours of sleep. It&#039;s not the greatest sleep - I fall off and wake up frequently without feeling I&#039;ve slept, but it&#039;s better than staring at the ceiling till dawn. It&#039;s expensive!"	30-Mar-16
127498	Phentermine	"So today is day 4 on phentermine. Starting out I cut out all processed foods and high carb foods and soda. I am only drinking water. I&#039;ve also been trying to stay active and have been on two 2 mile walks along with my regular moving around over the past few days. I have lost 6lbs!!!! SW:232LBS GW: 140LBS CW: 226LBS  It&#039;s probably mainly water weight. But still nice to see a decrease on the scale. :)"	5-Sep-17
141923	Escitalopram	"This medication has given me my life back!  I had crippling anxiety.  I never could sleep more than 2-4 hrs a night, was constantly fearful, and had daily panic attacks.  My anxious thoughts had become so obsessive, I couldn&#039;t even function.  Within a week of starting Lexapro, my irrational fears and obsessive thoughts started to decrease significantly, and after about a month, I was starting to feel &quot;normal&quot; again.  I have been on it for about 5 months now and I finally feel balanced (and haven&#039;t had a single panic attack).  Only complaints are that it makes me fairly sleepy often and sometimes I have weird dreams.  But the benefits FAR outweigh the side effects."	21-Jan-10
139021	Phentermine	"Have been taking Adipex for almost 2 weeks.  The first week I did notice an energy surge, but now I&#039;m back to my normal levels. I have no appetite in the morning, a bit of an appetite for lunch, and have to watch what I eat for dinner.  I vigorously exercise for 60 minutes 5 times a week.  I have lost 10 lbs so far.  I am glad for the help with the appetite, but am always contemplating the pros and cons."	22-Jun-09
128397	Phentermine	"Standing at 5&#039;3&quot; I weighed in at 228lbs Monday Sept 14th, started phentermine Tuesday mornin Sept 15th, within 20 minutes I felt a rush come over me, my heart was racing, I was sweating, numbing feeling in my arms, as well as, I felt that I couldn&#039;t get the right words out, almost tongue tied. Then about 6-8 hours later at dinner, I kept feeling like I was moving in slow motion. Side effects, the verge of a headache, not one, but could be triggered at any moment, dry mouth, and insomnia. I can usually only get 4-5 hours sleep tops. Which is extremely difficult with a 2 year old. But I have already lost 3lbs, I am keeping to a 1500 cal diet. No exercising yet due to heart rate being elevated at simple movements! Will start next week! I&#039;ll keep posting"	18-Sep-15

95952	Sertraline	"I am male, 53 years old, &amp; have been on Zoloft (Sertraline) 75mg for 1 year. My problem was with anxiety &amp; I became very sick. I first tried Celexa &amp; I felt worse. After 3 weeks I switched to Zoloft &amp; quickly noticed an improvement. It took about 3 to 4 weeks for Zoloft to start working effectively. By the 3rd month I felt even better &amp; any side effects stopped - they are: trouble sleeping &amp; I took Ativan to relax me and fall asleep, and after 3 months my sleep returned to normal; as for sex, maybe slightly longer to orgasm but no sexual dysfunction. As for alcohol, I still drink &amp; feel fine; there was sweating but this went away. Zoloft works, good luck!"	19-Jul-13
128133	Phentermine	"In January of 2015 I weighed 285lbs. at 5 foot 7 inches. I do have high blood pressure.I started a weight loss challenge and in 3 months with dieting and exercise I lost about 30lbs. I continued the same regimen and by February of 2016 I was 238. I seemed to have hit a wall.  On recommendation from my doctor I started phentermine 37.5 in the beginning of March.As of May 14, I weighed 228lbs. The medications does give dry mouth and your energy is increased. I have about 20 days before the end of 3 months on the meds and will seem my Doctor then to see what she recommends further. My goal weight is 210. I am 50 years old.1992 when I graduated Police Academy in the best shape on my life I weighed 200lbs. I want to get near that and maintain it"	15-May-16

For the last almost year now I have been dealing with this debilitating disorder and I finally had enough went to the doctors and now I&#039;m on 25mg to start. I feel horrible (Nauseated, dizzy, feeling of pressure in my head, slight numbness in lip and jaw and itchy dry feeling in the back of my mouth) but I&#039;m praying with all these positive responses about the medicine it will help me. I&#039;m at the end of my ropes I have two small children. I&#039;m trying to go to school and my anxiety is keeping me from being able to sit in class or go into the grocery store for longer than 2 mins! It has been horrible and came on for no apparent reason. I wish you all the best!"	20-Oct-11

63854	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been taking Setraline for about two weeks for Social anxiety and depression. . I used to take Paroxetine for 3 years and had to switch to Sertraline. Since I&#039;m taking Sertraline I&#039;ve noticed that I am grumpy and have a very short temper. Any little thing can blow my lid and I honestly hate myself at the moment. I&#039;m so easily irritated that it really annoys me. Yes, I&#039;m getting mad at myself for getting mad at anything. I experience no sexual side effects which is good because Paroxetine kind of muted me down there. It doesn&#039;t help much with my depression or social anxiety at the moment. I&#039;ll give it a month and maybe increase the dosage."	31-Aug-17
141154	Escitalopram	"lexapro helped me tremendously, it basically saved my life. I was horrified before I started, because of course I went online to see reviews and the side effects but all I got was bad experiences but mine has been amazing. I feel so much better, so much more free, like I&#039;m actually living again. I lost a little weight from it (which is a plus) and I feel great! I hope this helps for some people!"	5-Sep-15
138821	Phentermine	"This is my 2nd post to this site.  I have taken the pill for 4 weeks now and I am down 13 pounds.  I am very happy with my results.  It has cut my eating in half.  The weight loss is slowing down but I don&#039;t want quick results.  I just want to lose the weight.  I have 47 pounds to go.  It has cut my cravings for sweets.  I have a dry mouth but don&#039;t mind drinking more water.  I still give it a 10."	23-May-10
140871	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve been on it for 7 years. Worked like a magic bullet at first. Reduced severity and intrusiveness of thoughts and obsessions. Helped with panic attacks, anxiety and helped me get back on track. However, I have constant FATIGUE. I&#039;m fat now. I have no energy. Can&#039;t get anything done.  I love that my OCD is better but I can&#039;t go on like this."	22-May-16

128859	Phentermine	"I am 39 years old and I have been trying to flatten my stomach ever since I had my last child 15 years ago.  I will admit I do love food!  I heard about using Phentermine from a friend of mine, and I thought to myself, wow this might actually be what I am looking for!  So I made a doctors appointment and she gave me a script for this on June 6th 2014 and I got it filled and started right away, I was told to start out using only half, so I did and didn&#039;t feel that it was working using only half so the next day I started taking 1 whole pill.  I can say that it was all good, and to date I have not had any side effects.  When I started using this medication I weighed a wooping 186!! and today 7/23/14 I am at 168, &amp; want to be about 140."	23-Jul-14
34276	Tramadol	"I found tramodol to be very effective in controlling my back pain.  I was able to use the minimum dose for the most part, but knew that I could take another half pill if the pain was more severe, usually in the morning.  As the pain decreased, I did not feel the need to take the medicine as often, and was able to get off of it easily. I could function well while on this drug at the minimum dose."	11-Jul-08
64274	Sertraline	"Extreme anxiety and feelings of fear following 50 mg dose of sertraline, taken for 5 days only.  I stopped due to persistent nausea, retching and diarrhoea,  leaving me unable to eat or function. Now on Prozac which has less severe gastric effects"	10-Nov-16
64010	Sertraline	"I started taking Sertraline I&#039;d say a year ago. It seem to mellow out the depression and anxiety I was having. My doctor said we&#039;d try it out for 6 months then ween off of it. Once I got off of it, my depression and anxiety came back. So I started back up. It really helps keep me motivated during the day. I&#039;m currently taking 50mg a day. If I forget to take it, it&#039;s night and day!  I do feel like it wears off around 2:00 PM. I have to wait to talk to my doctor about taking a second dose in the afternoon. My only concern taking a dose in the afternoon will cause insomnia. Also, it&#039;s really killed my sex drive. I feel like I have to really force myself to want to have sex now. Has anyone else dealt with this problem, and how have you fixed it"	11-May-17
128568	Phentermine	"Started adipex 15mg once per day on 6/8/15, starting weight 214lbs. Weigh in on 6/22/15 was 203lbs. I&#039;m satisfied with this medicine &amp; I will continue to take it until I reach my weight goal. My dr advised me that I need to take it everyday for 3 weeks &amp; then take a week off so that I don&#039;t become intolerant of it. Side effects are minimal.  Really thirsty &amp; sometimes I dnt sleep too good."	26-Jun-15
128073	Phentermine	"I just started taking the pill on July 23 and I weigh 178, today is July 26 and I now weigh 174.  If you have dry mouth try chewing sugar free gum as a singer I use that trick all the time to keep my mouth moist and it works. Please drink lots of water as well, but it makes the dry mouth not so bad.  I have a thyroid condition so I take that pill early in the morning and I make myself eat a piece of toast or something 30 minutes later and take the pill and I don&#039;t have a problem sleeping at night.  I walk every other day and I have a decrease in my appetite, but I still eat. Some people say that don&#039;t eat at all that is not healthy.  Oh and I don&#039;t drink or eat anything with caffeine so I won&#039;t have a problem sleeping at night with the meds"	26-Jul-16
96552	Sertraline	"Very effective in controlling OCD and associated panic disorder.  However, gained 70 lbs (not by changing eating habits, but it&#039;s as though it raised my metabolic &quot;setpoint&quot;).  Decreased sex drive.  Despite the side effects, this medication has been a Godsend."	1-Mar-08
34104	Tramadol	"Found that the pain I was experiencing was much too severe to be treated with tramodol."	15-Sep-09
72024	Tramadol	"I was prescribed tramadol for pain relief after having all four of my wisdom teeth removed. After reading some of the reviews I felt like I had to post my experience, because everybody is different when it comes to pain tolerance and medication. I&#039;m taking 2, 50mg, roughly every 8 hours (or whenever I&#039;m noticeably uncomfortable) it worked, and still is, working wonders for me. Quick acting, no pain, and a euphoric feeling for many hours, but not debilitating - I still function fine, if not better. Sucks that it doesn&#039;t work for some people which in turn might turn others off from giving it a shot when it may work wonderfully for them! I can see how it could become addictive for people with addictive personalities, so be careful."	29-Jul-16
64613	Sertraline	"I&#039;m on day 11 of taking Zoloft 25mg. Thus far, I hate this drug. Put on it for anxiety and panic attacks. Doc wouldn&#039;t prescribe Xanax as I have an addictive personality so wanted to avoid benzos altogether. I&#039;ve experienced all the side effects of this drug within the first three days. Headaches, dizziness, diarrhea and anxiety seems worse than before I was put on this. I keep reading that it takes four to six weeks for the drug to take effect and that it gets worse before it gets better. Is this true? I&#039;m supposed to try to stay on it a full month and go from there. I&#039;m 41 and female. And thus far, hate this drug."	12-Feb-16

Diabetes, heart Disease run in the family and I have asthma and a shot lower back.  Recipe for obesity. Long story short. 2.5 months ago I was 322lbs. 2 weeks ago, I was 284 lbs. Shoot hoops once a week, and stick to 1800 calorie a day diet.  Beyond that, no special &quot;restrictions&quot;.  Oatmeal for breakfast, chicken/tossed green salad for lunch and whatever fits under my remaining carb window for dinner.  Only complaint is Ohio only allows 3 months of use.  No side effects after week 1."	14-Aug-12
141324	Escitalopram	"Have been on Mozarin(Escitalopram 15mg) for about 3 years with one few months interval trying to give it up. Greatly helps for depression and social anxiety, makes body dysmorphic disorder easier to handle and somehow accept but absolutely doesn&#039;t cure. After this period of time decided to go off the medication as didn&#039;t see it was strong enough anymore. It&#039;s much worse without it, planning to go back on it or maybe start something new. Only drawback horrible withdrawal symptoms passing after 2-3 weeks."	23-Jan-15
128037	Phentermine	"This medication works YES...HOWEVER it has side effects not listed &amp; if you don&#039;t workout then you&#039;re not going to see the same results as the people loosing the mass amounts of weight!!! I took this supplement/medication almost 6 years ago &amp; I worked my hind end off the 30 days I took it I lost 17 pounds that&#039;s all I need motivation to get me started in the right direction to a healthy life I worked out five days a wk changed all my eating habits (stopped eating when I was satisfied not full, if I craved it I bought it took a bite/drink and satisfied my craving) I was the smallest and healthiest I had ever been or so I thought till 2/25/15 when I had my gallbladder removed bc the damage me &amp; my dr believes to have been from the adipex!"	4-Aug-16
97246	Ambien	"I haven&#039;t been able to fall asleep until after 2 or 3am for about a year, even if I was extremely tired I would just lie in bed for hours. I would be lucky if I got 3-5 hours of sleep a night. My doctor prescribed me Ambien 2 weeks ago. I&#039;ve been getting the best sleep ever. I even wake up after 6-8 hours fully refreshed and awake. I&#039;m just happy to be getting a normal sleep. This really works. I have no stories of waking up in the middle of the night doing odd things."	6-May-09
64156	Sertraline	"I passed out from taking one sertraline 50Mg.  I had waves of all my nerves being on fire and extreme nausea.  It raised my blood pressure to over 200 and my blood sugar to over 200.  I realize that I&#039;m probably the exception, but in rare cases, one of the side effects listed is &quot;loss of consciousness&quot;.  Well, that was true for me.  If I could give this medicine a negative score I would.  I would rather be depressed than suffer what I went through with this stuff.  It was a nightmare!"	18-Jan-17
128153	Phentermine	"I am 5 feet tall and weighed 220 pounds at my highest weight, then I dropped 10 pounds with exercise and diet but plateaued. I started Phentermine on 4/19/2016 and weighed 210 and on 4/26/2016 I weighed in at 201.5!!! That&#039;s 8.5 pounds in a week! So excited to see what the next couple months bring for me!"	27-Apr-16
96934	Ambien	"Hands down the very best way to end the day. Not only is it the only sleeping pill that worked for me of the dozens of OTC and prescribed sleep aids, it felt really good. No matter how bad my day was, 20 minutes after I took the ambien I&#039;d always have a smile and laugh my ass off to Saturday Night Live episodes on Hulu before getting the best and consistent sleep ever. Sure, my first couple times I had a hangover effect, but the next year I was on ambien I ALWAYS felt refreshed the next morning."	26-Aug-16
96843	Ambien	"I&#039;ve had chronic insomnia most of my life, I took ambien 10mgs for 6 yrs it helped me so much to lead productive life, sleeping at night waking up in the morning with really no bad side effects, I don&#039;t live in the US anymore and ambien isn&#039;t available I think due the bad rap it gets by complainer&quot;s, while people like myself who have benefitted from it aren&#039;t as likely to review a drug, they haven&#039;t had a problem with - just human nature. I&#039;ve tried a whole host of anti-depresents &amp; other sedatives 7-8 none are as effective and have more side effects than ambien"	19-Apr-17
96445	Sertraline	"I was very depressed during and after my pregnancy. Finally I found a good doctor and she prescribed Zoloft. I felt the difference from the beginning. I had some side effects but nothing major, however the only complaint I have is the weight gain. I take 25mg daily, a very low dose but I am getting very heavy. I&#039;ve been taking Zoloft for almost 2 years and feel okay but not cured."	1-Jun-09

I would recommend this to anyone who wants a kick start to health. Meaning after the pill does what it needs to do you need to continue this life style change. Highly Recommended! I still have 20 more pounds to go and looking forward to it!!"	9-Oct-15
214662	Escitalopram	"I was on this for 2 months. It helped with anxiety, but wasn&#039;t worth the side effects. I gained weight, dry mouth, sleeplessness, and worst of all, little to no sex drive. If I thought of sex, it just seemed like work. When I did have sex with my girlfriend, I couldn&#039;t have an orgasm."	30-Aug-17
64481	Sertraline	"I was abusing alcohol for 5 years or so and was spiralling out of control. I went to the doctors on a couple of occasions and at first was offered only counselling. When I finally started taking sertraline about 7 months ago it changed my life. The first week in particular I struggled with the initial side effects such as insomnia and a strong &#039;spaced out&#039; feeling. The day I began taking sertraline was the day I stopped drinking alcohol and am now eating well. I have now been alcohol free for 7 months, my diet has never been so good and neither has my level of fitness. I&#039;m not saying that sertraline is the answer to all problems but for me it lifted a depression that I never knew I had and made we want to take care of myself again."	17-Jul-16
71870	Tramadol	"A few years back I developed anxiety and depression. Went on the SSRI and hated it. My dr. Then gave me Tramadol for my back and shoulder pain. But I found that it works better for me for my depression and anxiety.  After about 30 minutes from taking the pill I start to feel normal again and levelheaded"	22-Jun-16
96226	Sertraline	"This worked great to slow down my irritated reactions during a high period of stress in my life.  (Took 50 mg once a day). Now after doing a 2 week taper off (which that time was fine), now for the last 4 days of no sertraline at all, I FEEL SO EXTREMELY DIZZY THAT IT MAKES ME NAUSEATED, GRUMPY and I WOULD RATHER SLEEP IT OFF UNTIL THIS GOES AWAY. "	27-May-11
141210	Escitalopram	"The first week is hard. I took it with Xanax to make sure I could sleep through the night. Get through the side effects, and it will change your life. I&#039;m so happy. Night and day difference."	23-Apr-15
96347	Sertraline	"I started taking 50mg of Zoloft about 6 months ago.  I started taking it for depression, stress/anxiety.  It does the trick but there are two side effects I don&#039;t like.  First I have put on weight and second climaxing is near impossible.  "	28-Aug-09
140807	Escitalopram	"This is my second time on Lexapro. I took a 6 month break because I am not usually one for long-term medicine and it was causing me to gain weight.    However, I am too a point in my life where I feel like my GAD is just going to slowly kill me if I don&#039;t keep it under control (I am 26). Anyway, I&#039;ve never had any side-effects to this drug other than weight gain. And, I hope it&#039;s not the placebo effect, but I swear this stuff works the first day. I can feel my anxiety riddled, tense muscles loosening more and more. Give it a try! It&#039;s worth a shot to feel better!"	21-Jun-16
34219	Tramadol	"I was prescribed this medication for chronic severe neck pain.  I was taking 50mg per day.  While it worked to eliminate pain, I experienced constant nausea, vomiting, light headedness, and many symptoms of serotonin syndrome since I also take celexa each day.  Seroonin syndrome is serious and dangerous and can increase the likelihood of seizures.  Also, I&#039;m taking this medication at night and it keeps me awake all night instead of allowing a good night&#039;s rest.  "	24-Feb-09
34188	Tramadol	"I was taking Ultram ER 100 mg once a day along with Lyrica with no real relief. My doctor upped my Ultram to 200 mg once a day and I feel much better. I can&#039;t believe the difference the dosage makes. Off course, being time release it does take a while to kick in, but I found I can work a longer day sometimes."	17-Apr-09
127809	Phentermine	"I&#039;ve struggled with weight my whole life and I&#039;m only 22. My senior year of high school was the best I&#039;ve looked in entire life. I work out 3 times a week and eat fairly healthy. My doctor prescribed me this 1/25/17 and so far I feel great. I am 5&#039;2 and 198 as of right now. I struggle with deep depression and anxiety and I have been having really bad days. Today is the best day I&#039;ve had in a few months. I have had cotton mouth all day and felt jittery but that&#039;s okay with me since it&#039;s the most energy I&#039;ve had in a while. I will update my weight in a week!"	26-Jan-17
34210	Tramadol	"I have been taking ultram for 5 years now. I take it to help with the chronic pain caused by fibromyalgia. It is the only drug that I have taken that allows me to perform tasks without experiencing extremely intrusive pain. I am 27 years old and without this medication I do not believe I could have reached the goals that I have today."	12-Mar-09
214690	Escitalopram	"I started taking 5mg escitalopram about 2 1/2years ago for pain which was also causing me some very mild but noticeable emotional feelings. After a month it was increased to 10mg which I kept taking for the next 10 months. Because I was feeling much better I decided to stop taking it. I noticed my pain levels were rising again and I was becoming (very mildly) emotionally sensitive. 3 or 4 months later I started on 10mg, 15mg and after two months 20mg. I have felt the best on 10mg I&#039;m feeling so much better again but did feel the best on 10mg. After talking with a professional family member who knows this medication &amp; with my doctor I have decided to continue long-term on 10mg along with common sense use of pain management. Hopes this helps"	29-Sep-17
96505	Sertraline	"I started taking Zoloft in October of 2003 for depression and attention deficit disorder. I have had no complaints. This is a wonderful medicine for me. I have found that the brand name works better on me than the generic brand. I know they aren&#039;t supposed to be different but they are. On the generic I have suicidal thoughts which I didn&#039;t have before I started on the medicine. On the brand name, I don&#039;t have this issues and feel so much better. I like myself and other people like me better too."	26-Nov-08
71661	Tramadol	"This medicine does not work for pain whatsoever. It&#039;s like something docs give to trick you into thinking you&#039;re taking pain meds.  IDK what&#039;s in it. It does not work.  Thanks druggies, for making it hard for people that are actually in pain short term to get effective meds."	3-Aug-17
97311	Ambien	"Working very well for me but nervous about how long I can be on it.  It&#039;s been just over a month.  Worried I&#039;ll never be able to sleep good if I go off it."	13-Nov-09
72588	Tramadol	"I have taken Tramadol as prescribed by my doctor for a little over 2 years. It works 100% for my restless legs syndrome. The only downside to this medication is the withdrawal symptoms when you stop. You have twice as bad the problem of restlessness than you had in the first place. The doctor gave me Clonidine and that really helped with the withdrawal problems."	2-Sep-10
96101	Sertraline	"I went to the doctor because I was having anxiety/stress issues. I was getting along with any of my co-workers, I was crying at work for no reason, and I just wasn&#039;t myself. I had never taken any prescription medicine before Zoloft. My doctor said she thought I had anxiety, and maybe depression. I was prescribed 50mg Zoloft to start for a few weeks. I was supposed to move up to 100mg, but the 50mg are doing just fine. I have been on Zoloft for about three months now, and I do no have any side effects, nor did I when I first started. I was also prescribed Xanax as needed, but I haven&#039;t even had to take any since I started the Zoloft."	28-Apr-12
97046	Ambien	"It truly works great! I am so happy that my doctor prescribed it for me for my insomnia."	26-Oct-13
64870	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been on Sertraline for 5 months now I started out at 50mg and it seemed to be ok my anxiety attacks were becoming far less and I was a lot happier then about 3 months later I found I was having panic attacks again and now for the last month I&#039;ve been on 100mg my mood is so bad it&#039;s affecting my relationship and I always just feel down and worthless I&#039;m going back to the doctor soon to hopefully sort it out"	19-Apr-15
96389	Sertraline	"I have been on Zoloft for 18 months now and I LOVE it.  I first went on it for some postpartum depression paired with several other major situations that were going on in my life.  After the first few days I felt like I could deal with my life, like this was something I always should have been on.  I have always dealt with bouts of depression and anxiety but was never put on any medication but I should have been. I will continue this Zoloft as long as my doctor will allow."	6-Dec-09
71828	Tramadol	"I was facing several months of on and of depression since being forced to move. I had and have no one to communicate with anymore. The loneliness made me realize how empty my life is and see no purpose in anything. I lost all motivation. The greater issue was that I was starting to feel like this everyday and started pondering suicide. I decided ro try Tramadol since it was available to me. I took 100 mg to test it and I felt normal again (able to feel pleasure and then some).  The experience was amazing and it gave my social confidence I was lacking. As the Tramadol wore off I was able to speak in a debate group without issue (I usually get nervous and lose track) and it was noticed. I alI&#039;v"	15-Apr-16
128219	Phentermine	"I have now been on Phentermine for a week. I have already lost 5 lbs. I need to lose another 20. I am not obese but am on two cholesterol medications. I always weighed the same until my thyroid medication was too low and I gained 20 lbs. I could not get it off no matter what I did...until Phentermine came into my life. I am experiencing none of the side effects except dry mouth. What I am experiencing though  is 1) higher energy; 2) better sleep; 3)a feeling of well being; 4) more focused; 5) less appetite; 6)more stamina. I am only on 15mg per day and feel wonderful."	10-Mar-16
63998	Sertraline	"After taking on too many large life changes and adjustments and dealing with long term and recent grieving  issues, I was prescribed sertraline. Started at 25mgs and went up to 50 mgs. Worked very closely with a couple of psychiatrists. Also started a 7.5 mg dose of mirtazapine before bed to help with sleeping at the same time. Started having very vivid dreams all night long, not bad dreams just very vivid and felt lucid and aware during the dreaming. I slept well but remember too much of my dreams on waking. Sleep time felt too &quot;active&quot; and I found it distracting. One of the psychiatrists claimed it was the mirtazapine but the other one suggested that it was the sertraline (Zoloft) and reduced, then eliminated the sertraline. Right move."	19-May-17
95958	Sertraline	"Zoloft has saved my life. I have been on Zoloft 200 mg for 7 months and the results have been amazing. I suffered from severe OCD, anxiety, and mind racing. Zoloft and Abilify 5 mg have completely eliminated my symptoms. I can now live and enjoy my life thanks to Zoloft 200 mg and Abilify 5 mg."	4-Jul-13
96246	Sertraline	"I started taking Zoloft when work stress and other issues got really bad. I had gone to a doctor for cognitive behavioral therapy previously to help with social anxiety, but it didn&#039;t seem to work. So I tried going on Zoloft per a GP suggestion. I first started on 50mg, and the side effects (super drowsy during the day, couldn&#039;t sleep at night, shakiness) were pretty awful for the first couple of weeks, but I stuck with it out of desperation. I am glad I did. My boyfriend says that he sees a huge change. And I don&#039;t feel so very, very awful about everything. I feel like I can see my circular negative thoughts now in a third-party point of view. It hasn&#039;t stopped my negative feelings, but it is helping me not to think about them over and over. Taking 100mg."	9-Mar-12
128873	Phentermine	"My experience was successful!  I started the pill on 03-26-14 at which time I was 287 lbs, by 04-30-14, I dropped down to 276 lbs. I must say it really suppresses the appetite and I recommend that you eat at least breakfast daily to avoid getting headaches and feeling nausea.  Altough, I did have those side effects, I do recommend eating something again as stated preferably breakfast. The last time I weighed myself I wore 266, however,  because I am no longer eating healthy and taking the pill when I remember to take one I notice I have gained some of the weight back as my pcp indicated I would. All in all Phentermine is great if you are going to adjust to permenant lifestyle changes / eating behaviors."	9-Jul-14
141835	Escitalopram	"I suffered from anxiety/depression since I was 16. I&#039;m 25 now. I started self medicated in my early 20&#039;s.  When I tried to stop due to addiction issues, my symptoms worsened to the point where I woke every morning with a feeling of intense dread.  I felt the world was against me, I had severe social anxiety, and I was trapped in my own head.  Enter Lexapro 10mg.  I&#039;ve only been on this medicine for 2 weeks and I feel SO much more emotionally stable. Felt a positive difference Day 1.   I&#039;m able to deal with real problems now instead of make believe ones.  I&#039;m so much more in control.  The world isn&#039;t nearly as threatening as it was before.  It&#039;s all a bit funny now, I don&#039;t take myself or anyone else too seriously.  No side effects either."	6-Aug-11
128729	Phentermine	"So I have always struggled with my weight, I am either trying to loose weight or gaining it....there is never an steady weight for me. I feel like I can loose weight rather quickly if I give up 100% of my mindset on it, but the downside of that is I also gain just as quickly. Now that I am in my late 30&#039;s the extra weight is now effecting my health causing high blood pressure, high cholesterol, very low self esteem, and complete misery. I love clothes, but never even want to get dressed anymore because I am uncomfortable and can&#039;t wear what I love. I am to the point that the extra weight is changing my once outgoing, bubbly personality into a shy, quiet girl because I am uncomfortable in my skin. I hope this helps! I need it badly."	31-Mar-15
72317	Tramadol	"I used Ultram for 3 years for chronic back pain/sciatica. It&#039;s the only medicine that relieved the pain every time. I took 1-3 50mg pills per day and NEVER had to increase dosage. HOWEVER, I started having memory/attention problems, shaking, blurry vision and possible seizures (being evaluated now).  I&#039;ve been off Ultram for nearly a month now and it feels like the veil has been lifted... like my brain&#039;s back, clarity. But my original pain feels twice as bad, I have restless legs syndrome and am sleeping MAYBE 4 hours per night. All are symptoms of withdrawal. It worked great for the pain.  "	30-Aug-11
139162	Phentermine	"Awesome. It really works with little to no side effects.  The worst that happened was in the first 2-3 days I had the &quot;feeling restless or aggressive&quot; symptom and the extremely dry mouth.  After that, I was fine."	2-Apr-09
138471	Phentermine	"Today is only my second day on this medication, and so far I am very pleased! I only have 20lbs to lose, but was stuck and needed help getting there. I took my first 37.5 pill yesterday at 630 and had the most euphoric happy feeling! I was not jittery, just hyper. Not the sick feeling you get from caffeine. (I am not a caffeine user). I did experience some hot flashes, but only for an hour. I was very satisfied with a ViShake for breakfast and lunch. I ate a 1/2 cup of broccoli and 6oz of venison for dinner and was stuffed! I couldn&#039;t finish it! I did get the dry mouth they talk about, but as for the insomnia, it never  happened. I actually was tired and went to bed and slept my usual 7 hours! I will update in a few weeks! Love this pill!"	30-Oct-13
63972	Sertraline	"I was on this medication for about 2 months and it was an awful experience. I started out on 25mg and I couldn&#039;t really feel any emotions, so they increased the dosage to 50mg. I started feeling worse, so I was told to increase the dosage again. Once I got to 75mg, I started becoming angry, even more anxious than I was before, I had an out-of-body experience, and I was becoming incredibly impulsive. After trying another anti-depressant and failing, it is believed that I have a mood disorder and was placed on mood stabilizers."	28-Jun-17
72394	Tramadol	"Good at relieving pain for a short duration (4 hours at a time) with few side effects. I found that at 200mg/day my pain was cut in half and I had increased energy and a brighter mood.  I have used this medicine for 4 years now and find that it is very effective for about four months.. and then effectiveness decreases.  At that point, my doctor switches me to a narcotic for three to four weeks and then I can continue with the tramadol over again with a &quot;reset&quot; in the effectiveness factor.  The strongest negative for me is getting off the tramadol... withdrawl effects include major mood swings, insomnia, and dizziness.  But overall, it is quite effective and has very few bad effects for me while taking it."	8-Jan-11
119777	Ambien CR	"I have severe insomnia and Ambien CR has worked very well for me. Previously, I tried the Ambien IR and while it did knock me out for a good 3-4 hours, it didn&#039;t help me to stay asleep and the Ambien CR does just that. My only complaint is some days I seem to very drowsy and sluggish, but most of the time I wake up feeling refreshed and ready tackle the day."	20-Dec-15
96421	Sertraline	"I suffer from bipolar disorder/extreme anxiety which prevented me from living life. I am on a mood stabilizer Lamictal- helped greatly with mania, did nothing for depression. I had no interest in life, couldn&#039;t stand my husband, didn&#039;t like my cats and dogs to be near me and would not do any chores. My husband had to do all the chores. I have only been on Zoloft 25 mgs for 3 days and already am feeling better. Last night let my hubby lay near me while watching TV without me wanting to kill him, let my cat lay on my tummy without pushing her away. Today I woke finding I am yawning all, but already, dare I say a tad more happy! Hoping even better things to come!"	9-Dec-10
127818	Phentermine	"The first day, it was great!!!  Did NOT have an appetite. In a week I had lost 4 pounds. After 2 months,  it gives me energy for 7-8 hrs.  Then, I CRASH &amp; eat everything in sight.  Dr. says--Be Patient.  Crazy way to live.  My other meds all make me gain weight!!"	21-Jan-17
141311	Escitalopram	"I waited 2 months to write this because I was convinced it wouldn&#039;t work for me. Lexapro WORKS. Stick it out before giving up. I got much worse before I got better. I started at 10 mg and am now at 20 mg. In the beginning, my anxiety and obsessive thoughts got a lot worse, and when I increased my dose it spiked up again. But it finally passed and the difference is huge. I feel like me again, but me without crippling anxiety and constant obsessive thoughts. My periods do make it worse. My side effects of dry mouth, constipation, sleeplessness, heavy sweating all are gone now. And NO sexual issues for me. Oh, and don&#039;t be scared of the generic - that&#039;s what I take. Hang in there and give it time!"	23-Nov-14
214557	Escitalopram	"I have been on Lexapro for about 5 years now and it completely and utterly changed my life. I had very serious anxiety which caused my relationships problems, problems in my job and all over my life, I was erratic  and an emotional rollercoaster, after 2 weeks on Lexapro I felt stable and always the happiest person in the room, my brain needs this to function correctly without a doubt. I look back and cant believe I was the person I once was."	19-Oct-17
139008	Phentermine	"I have been on this medication once before and lost interest in it because I was not feeling like I had lost weight. I decided I would try it again. I started it on June 13th weighing 359. I weighed myself on June 19th and had lost an amazing 18lbs. My doctors appointment is Saturday and everyone has noticed a big difference in me. I&#039;ve lost 2 pant sizes, and 1 shirt size. This stuff really does work."	9-Jul-09
96451	Sertraline	"I have just started taking 50mg a day and noticed increased yawning and I&#039;m really tired."	19-May-09
96184	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been on Zoloft for about two weeks now and I&#039;ve noticed a considerable difference in my demeanor. The very first day I took it, it upset my stomach severely. I was so nauseous and had intestinal issues...yikes. But the next day I felt great. My doctor recommended I take a half pill for the first few days. I have had some relationship issues and work issues and I suffer from anxiety and depression. I have obsessive, negative thoughts about my relationship and it was seriously impacting it. I was fighting with my partner everyday because I couldn&#039;t stop thinking about our problems. Since I&#039;ve taken the medicine, we had one fight. I do sleep a ton though I seem to be shaking that off a little. I feel like so far so good."	11-Jan-12
72077	Tramadol	"I&#039;m 19 and I have had fybromyalgia since Oct of 2014. I take 100mg everynight and my rheumatologist said to take with 500mg Tylenol. It helps so much I also take 5 300mg caps of gabapentin a day."	25-Mar-15
141213	Escitalopram	"I take this 20 MG a day along with Carbamazepine  (tegratol/equetro). The two medicines together really make me feel &quot;normal&quot;. I don&#039;t feel like a zombie. I feel a bit of euphoria on this. This is a good thing, but I can see how that can make some people become dependant on it. However, I feel great on this. I feel a tiny bit tired but I&#039;m not sure if it is one of my meds or my 3 kids tiring me out. Otherwise,  no major side effects. Maybe some issues with vaginal dryness but lubricant helps. Doesn&#039;t kill my libido the way some antipsychotics can."	20-Apr-15
72069	Tramadol	"Tramadol would MILDLY work for my back and knee pain for about a week and then stop.  Oxycodone works best for me and hydrocodone is second.  If it works for your pain, great but my experience is that it does nothing more than ibuprofen or other OTC pain relievers in the long run.  The physical withdrawal from tramadol in my opinion is worse than hydrocodone or oxycodone due to the dual action it has on the brain."	11-Apr-15
141431	Escitalopram	"For years I have been struggling with constant Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with periods of deep depression. I finally stopped trying to &quot;put up with it&quot; and blaming myself, and went on Cipralex. I started at 5mg and I am at 20 now. The first few days, I had a weird mixture of dry mouth and hypersalivation, felt fuzzy, lethargic, and SO hungry for salty/greasy food.  The unpleasant effects have subsided although I do sometimes feel extra sleepy still. My Generalized Anxiety Disorder has been reduced drastically, I no longer ruminate and obsess to the point of feeling paralyzed, when worries come up I can let them go with greater ease and do what I need to do. HOWEVER my OCD (skin picking) has not improved at all, which is strange!"	30-Dec-13
78530	Allegra	"Works much better than other over the counter medicines. My allergy came back this time of the year, and this year got worse. My sneezing won&#039;t stop even to the point I get nosebleed. So I tried Allegra, it did suppressed all the sneezing for hours, however my nose still somewhat congested. When they mean &quot;non-drowsy&quot;, they really mean it. I took other over the counter allergy medicines before, which they listed as &quot;non-drowsy&quot;, but I constantly found myself falling asleep every now and then."	4-Apr-11
64124	Sertraline	"I took sertraline (zoloft) for 4 days before quitting it. The first day I felt very tired and slightly nauseous. After that I was having very loose stools, headaches, drowsiness, dizziness, and overall sense of just not being myself. Today I had my first full blown panic attack in almost 2 years (I&#039;ve been on clonazepam since my last panic attack). I know people always say to keep pushing through the side effects but I couldn&#039;t. I had to leave work and I went home and cried for hours. I felt like a complete zombie for the last 3 days. Obviously this drug effects everyone differently but for me, it was absolute hell. :("	14-Apr-17
96077	Sertraline	"I&#039;m a 44 yr. old female and I&#039;ve taken 50mg of Zoloft for 3 weeks now. I&#039;m grateful for it. It&#039;s helped depression, OCD, PTSD, anxiety, panic attacks, terrible thoughts, mood swings, and my urge to drink alcohol. The biggest relief of all is that it&#039;s helped my PMDD! I felt a weird feeling in my legs, at night, for a bit, but that seems to have gone away a few nights ago. I have dry mouth and chew gum to help. I feel lifted, happier, calmer, make better choices and feel clearer in my thought process and more alert and aware. Pre-menopause/PMDD, can cause you to feel like your going crazy...you&#039;re NOT, it is HORMONAL. Ask your doctor about this! Wish I had 4 yrs ago, it is working for me and maybe it can help others. Good luck!"	18-Jun-12
141379	Escitalopram	"So after my grandma passed away I started having those panic attacks. In class around people and I didn&#039;t want to go out. I was a fun outgoing person and suddenly I was someone else. I didn&#039;t like myself. I lost weight I hate looking in the mirror I didn&#039;t wanna fix myself or dress well. And so I had to see a psychiatrist and he told me to take Cipralex 10mg for 6months so I traveled to the States to see the family my life has changed a lot but I still fear being in crowded places or going out clubbing and sometimes I get those anxiety attacks. How can I get rid of them completely??"	22-Sep-14
138565	Phentermine	"I am 5&#039;1&quot; and weighed 192.2 when I saw the doctor. Exercise and dieting weren&#039;t helping me and he was concerned the weight may be the reason why my blood pressure is high and why my PCOS has been acting out. So he put me on Adipex-P and so far so good. I have lost 5 lbs in 10 days since starting the medication. I feel super energetic too."	9-Apr-13
141178	Escitalopram	"I just want say this medication has been a complete life saver for me I went from having bad anxiety and just generally crappy attitude of always being upset and grumpy and ocd on other peoples character defects until i started taking this medication which at first was hard the first 2 -3 days were rough and than I decided to cut the 10mg pill in half and thats when I noticed my change I was just genuinely happy about just being alive and happy about starting my day things I would usually get upset and obsess about just roled off me like no big deal and I found now that I am able to carry on and have a regular great day so thank you so much to my doc and Lexapro for being a solution for now and maybe for my lifetime if need be"	24-Jun-15
140898	Escitalopram	"I have been living with anxiety for years and was prescribed escitalopram. I started with 5mg for a month and increased to 10mg. The side effects were not nice, particularly for about a month after I increased the dosage. I was nauseous, constantly tired but couldn&#039;t sleep, racing thoughts but foggy brain, increased anxiety and also not caring. But I have now been on 10mg for 2.5months and I feel great! I have confidence I never knew I had, everyday isn&#039;t a struggle, I don&#039;t overthink everything I say or do, my mind is so much clearer. Things feel effortless and everyone is saying how great I look. I found a combination of escitalopram and counselling has worked wonders for me. Stay with it, its totally worth it. I&#039;m glad I did :)"	19-Jan-16
64552	Sertraline	"After back to back traumatic events in late 2015 I found myself struggling with PTSD, severe depression, panic attacks and anxiety. I was hesitate on starting this medication due to the side effects. I started off at 25 mg and gradually increased to 100mg. Initial side effects included loss of appetite, insomnia, increased anxiety and diaherra. It was a struggle to make it through the side effects but completely worth it! I noticed the full effect after 6 weeks and the side effects subsided after a month. I&#039;ve never felt so great and haven&#039;t had a panic attack in over two months. This medication along with cognitive therapy has helped and made my life 100% better. If you&#039;re reading this and hesitate about starting this medication, don&#039;t be."	11-Mar-16
95882	Sertraline	"I decided to visit a psychiatrist for the first time 2 weeks ago because I have been dealing with anxiety and mild depression for almost 2 years. He prescribed me sertraline 50mg. I didn&#039;t start until a week later because I was scared (anxiety) about taking medicine for the first time and the possible consequences so I kept reading about it especially in this site. So after taking the medication for a week (first 5 days I only took half a pill per day) I can only say that it&#039;s been a positive experience. My anxiety is almost gone and I feel much happier and calmed. I can study and work without feeling anxious and fearful or depressed feeling sad.Cons: thirsty all the time; dry mouth. During the first 5 days only I felt sleepy and a little bit numb."	15-May-14
214696	Escitalopram	"I had a terrible experience on this drug. It resulted in me having regular panic attacks, heart palpitations, caused me to become trapped in negative state and paranoid. I&#039;m not one who reviews meds very often but this medication proved to be very dangerous for me. I spent a lot of time in a state of paranoia. My Dr did not listen to me when I kept stating it wasn&#039;t right for me. In the end I reduced my dose ( I don&#039;t condone this though ) and have been off it for around 4 months now. I can honestly say I&#039;m doing much better , able to function, don&#039;t stay on states of paranoia etc. I&#039;m also able to make clear choices etc."	25-Sep-17
141798	Escitalopram	"I have been only taking Lexapro 10mg for less than a week....The first couple of days I felt great but now I am starting to feel some side effects. It is making me zone out and feel &quot;blah&quot; and very tired. My doctor assured me that I may feel this way for a month or so then it should ease off. I am hoping so but it has helped with my depression and anxiety."	17-Jan-11
128561	Phentermine	"I started Phentermine 37.5 on 5/27/15. I did cut my intake tremendously thanks to the phentermine. I will be honest my physical activity could have been a lot more I worked out only periodically(hardly ever). As of 6/25/15 I had lost 13lbs. I started at 302 5&#039;8 now I&#039;m 289. This has really motivated me to work harder during the second month of my prescription. If these pills could help me lose 13 lbs with hardly any physical activity what could they do if I got off my butt! Feeling really excited and optimistic."	29-Jun-15
71664	Tramadol	"I have been taking Tramadol capsules for 6 months, deal with severe pain from torn tendons, both ankle and shoulder. Main purpose to help me get a reasonable night&#039;s sleep. Two capsules of 50mg taken 7pm have been very successful. There have been no side effects, I have been very satisfied with results. 14 days ago my chemist gave me Tramedo, 50mg capsules, as he did not have Tramadol in stock.... said they were the same. For the first time ever, I accepted replacement product. After 10 days,  have been sleeping well past normal wake time, been very tired during  rest of day,  gasto problems, have had bruising (?) in the circles under my eyes that looked like blood blisters, and poorer vision. The supplying company have not returned my call"	21-Apr-17
138621	Phentermine	"I started Apidex on March 21st weighing 233lbs. Now on May 21st I weight 205lbs with very little excerise. Very happy with the outcome. Going to start working out, hopefully will get to my goal weight of 170."	21-May-12
128813	Phentermine	"I&#039;m not exercising at all. I&#039;m just eating right. I have been on it 6 days now and I&#039;ve lost 9 pounds. 1300 calories a day !!!"	16-Nov-14
64801	Sertraline	"The first week was the hardest, but I found that taking Xanax made the side effects easier to handle.  After 7 days, I started noticing a difference.  I hope I continue to improve as time passes"	29-Jul-15
128159	Phentermine	"I started taking the pills started March 22 with a weight of 254 Lb a month after 232 Lb weight fully recommended."	22-Apr-16
128006	Phentermine	"Started first half pill today...less appetite...goose bumps on arms....if it works on half do I hve to take full pill???"	3-Sep-16
139152	Phentermine	"I started taking it on March 17th and was weighed in at 178lbs. Since I am only 5 foot tall you would say I was rather large. I just went for my 3 week check up and have lost 8 pounds. The only side effects have been sleeplessness and dry mouth, which in turn was a good thing. Now I drink lots of water and before I didn&#039;t drink any water. This stuff really works. I would recommend it to anyone who has a weight problem."	15-Apr-09
139079	Phentermine	"I started taking Phentermine 6 weeks ago. I have only lost 6 lbs. However, I feel like I&#039;m on an emotional roller-coaster and I&#039;m not sure if it is because of the medication. Some days I just want to cry for no reason at all. It also makes me sleepy. Not jittery. I have always had trouble sleeping so I can&#039;t say it has caused my insomnia. It does make you not hungry though. I have to remind myself to eat. Sex drive seems to be disappearing too. "	20-Mar-09
141479	Escitalopram	"Male, late 40&#039;s.  Earlier summer events created extended stress that eventually broke me.  Every morning I&#039;d wake with sweat rolling down my neck, lost my appetite and the worst-case scenario of everything played in my mind.  I&#039;m normally the &quot;rock&quot; that everyone turns to.  Started with Wellbutrin for 2 weeks but that left me with heightened anxiety.  Spent a couple weeks on Propranolol / Klonopin but that &#039;s not a long term solution.  Started 10 mg Lexapro (generic) and after 5 1/2 weeks, nothing but crazy emotional swings.  Switched to 20 mg and after about 2 weeks noticed a distinct change.  Greatly reduced symptoms so far.  Skeptical as I was, this stuff actually works."	8-Nov-13
141535	Escitalopram	"I was always a worrier and an anxious individual. It never came to mind to label these characteristics as someone suffering from generalized anxiety disorder. Well late last year I began to worry obsessively about my health and became completely consumed by my fearful thoughts. One panic attack led to another and before I knew what had happened, I could barely leave the house or function. That&#039;s when I realized I needed help. Admitting that I needed help was probably the hardest part of my struggle since I always thought of myself as an independent and confident person. I was put on 10mg of Lexapro and after approximately 5 weeks I was able to &quot;live&quot; again with some mild anxiety. I did gain about 10 pounds in the 9 months since starting the medication, worth it!"	12-Sep-13
128651	Phentermine	"I have taken adipex before and lost 70 lbs in 3 months. I ran two miles everyday and ate lean cuisines. I was on a 1200 calorie diet. It took me two years to gain the weight back, being in college life gets busy and it just happened. Now I&#039;m back on it and have lost 20 lbs in 3 weeks. I recommend it to anyone who is serious about losing weight. You have to work hard to see amazing results, but it&#039;s completely worth it. From the comments I&#039;ve seen some people were only prescribed it for 2 or 3 months, it may be a location issue but my doctor in MS will prescribe adipex for a patient for 6 months out of the year."	14-Apr-15
141244	Escitalopram	"I have been on Lexapro 10 mg  for a year and a half for depression and anxiety, along with generic remeron 15mg as sleep aid. Last summer I switched to only generic remeron (mirtrazipine) and my mood started to go up and down.  The thing with lexapro is it takes away inhibition. That also includes being more impulsive. So be careful when upset. It also ramped up anxiety in the first couple of weeks  and drives you nuts. I am getting back slowly on lexapro for 2 weeks. I got a few anxiety crisis so I take half 10mg and will try to increase slowly. Despite this minus, this is the best thing so far. BTW, generic escitalopram sucks. Tried and doesn&#039;t do the trick for  me."	12-Mar-15
141346	Escitalopram	"I&#039;m 22 years old and have suffered from post traumatic stress disorder/ depression since I was a youngster stemming from childhood sexual abuse. This medicine has saved my life, it took about a month/ month and a half to kick in, but when it did it really eased my symptoms. I did experience some mild side effects in the beginning, but they all went away except for some loss of libido and delayed ejaculation. Overall, I would recommend this medicine to someone who is in a similar situation as I found myself in."	14-Nov-14
141692	Escitalopram	"I&#039;m on day 2 of taking Lexapro and it&#039;s causing unpleasant side effects. I don&#039;t have an appetite, a slight headache, nervousness, and stinging chest pain along with stomachache. My doctor told me to stick with it because the benefits outweigh any issues right now. He also said that they will go away in 2 weeks or so.  I&#039;ll continue to take and update my progress."	23-Nov-12
140841	Escitalopram	"I went on Lexapro for depression and anxiety. I noticed that generally it relieved my anxiety symptoms, but had some bad side effects for me. Most troubling was the weight gain. I&#039;ve always been quite slim, but while on Lexapro I gained about 30 pounds, so that was very distressing for me. Also, if I forgot to take my medication I&#039;d get terrible migraines. I&#039;m now transitioning off of this medication because of the weight gain. I&#039;ve already started to see a difference and lost a couple of pounds (with healthy eating and regular exercise). Overall, this med was good for my anxiety, but meh for everything else."	27-May-16
97100	Ambien	"Best sleeping product on the market today!"	6-Feb-13
140991	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve only been on this for 3 weeks, but feel less anxious and irritable than I have for a few years. Started on 5mg daily for 10 days and then 10 mg daily. No side effects at all. Well worth trying."	13-Mar-16
140676	Escitalopram	"I was prescribed 25mg of escitalopram for my anxiety at work/social anxiety. I had tried before Amitriptyline which is an older medicine for this but it made me really sleepy, literally it would knock me down for 12 hours which was very disruptive.    I started a new job which was demanding and escitalopram kept me calmed and still I was able to think clearly. The problem with it is that as the previous medicine it made me sleepy (I&#039;d come home after work and I&#039;d be exhausted, just wanted to lie in bed and read). Also I gained lots of weight, it made me less active (stopped gym) and made me crave carbohydrates which caused this. It did work though. My doctor has switched me to Zoloft, when I have more info I&#039;ll write on that"	24-Sep-16
128899	Phentermine	"Started 12 days ago at 231lbs., I have lost 11 lbs. No exercise, no cravings...its great! I take the pill 37.5 mg at 7 a,m so I sleep at night with no problems. I wish I would have tried this sooner rather than trying so many fad diets, wasting time. I feel in control of my eating for the first time in years, no more hitting the drive through on the way to &amp; from work each day. Bonus...I have extra cash now that I am not going out all the time buying junk &amp; snacks all day."	29-May-14
127986	Phentermine	"I started taking phentermine yesterday, I was really happy with how much energy I had. Not any noticeable side effects besides maybe caffeine type high but the insomnia was really noticeable. Hoping it calms down but I&#039;m 5&#039;2 197lbs and I&#039;ve been working out at the gym eating healthier and just can&#039;t seem to drop weight. Hoping this will give me the boost and gain confidence and keep it going. CW197 GW130"	14-Oct-16
97145	Ambien	"I&#039;ve been taking Ambien since January 2006 and about 4 weeks ago I began to have issues sleeping only been getting 2-3 hrs a night. I called my psychologist and family doctor about the situation. I was given Lunesta through my family doctor. Tried that for a couple days and couldn&#039;t still couldn&#039;t sleep. Then I thought it was my Wellbutrin so I went &quot;cold turkey&quot; on that for about a week until I almost had a break down. Then I started taking half of my Wellbutrin and feel a little better. My psychologist just gave me a prescription for the Ambien Cr and only have taken for 2 nights so far. I just want some sleep.. my grades are suffering and so is my job."	5-Apr-11
128800	Phentermine	"Had to have my thyroid removed because of cancer, after my surgery my weight went way up from 130 pounds to 205! Surgeon finally stabilized my thyroid medicine and I went down to my normal weight. (2011-2012) now I&#039;m back up to 186 pounds! I have tried exercising and dieting with nothing but a big FAIL! Wasn&#039;t even able to lose one pound! Finally my specialist gave me phentermine 37.5! I have only taken it so far for five days (today is day 6) and I have lost about 11 pounds 177.6 is my weight. I feel excellent on this medication and would recommend it to anyone struggling to lose weight! I am definitely going to try to start exercising again this week! Will keep everyone posted. Side effects dry mouth &amp; mood but can handle it."	28-Dec-14
96135	Sertraline	"I have been on Zoloft for a couple of years. Like many, I read the reviews and was afraid to take it, but having established a good connection with my physician and trusting her judgment, I decided to try it out for a few months. We gradually stepped up the dosage, and I am now on 150mg. It really does work wonders for me. I used to worry constantly and was very irrational about some of these worries. I had severe anxiety over my job, and it was starting to reflect negatively in my performance. Now that I am on Zoloft, I feel much more even-keeled, and I don&#039;t seem to ever be too worried about anything. I can have rational thoughts about things that concern me. It doesn&#039;t work for everyone, but it&#039;s worth a shot if you suffer from anxiety."	10-Nov-11
141217	Escitalopram	"I have been on 10mg of Lexapro 3 days. Day one: I was really dizzy and couldn&#039;t keep my eyes open. Day 2: was awful. I kept throwing up a few hours after taking it. It felt like a hangover and flu mixed. Everything hurt. By the end of day 2 I noticed I wasn&#039;t spending my day planning, thinking, and breaking down tiny details. I was in the moment. It was a little boring at times but it was extremely refreshing. It was amazing to want to go do things without having to make sure everything was thought of. There were no rushes of chest pains. I felt like I should tell everyone how wonderful it was like not be consumed by thought. Day 3: light dizziness and sore muscles. light anxiety after an argument and a concert. I have very high hopes now."	13-Apr-15
128819	Phentermine	"I am 43 years old, started 4 weeks ago at 186 lbs now at 171.  Sticking with a low calorie/low carb diet.  Getting in lots of cardio.  The pill isn&rsquo;t magic, it&rsquo;s been a lot of work losing, keeping track of foods, finding time to exercise and cook healthy meals for lunch and dinner.  The pill has curbed my appetite, helped with focus and motivation.  No side effects after first week (insomnia, dry mouth).  All around pleased with results but wonder if I could have done it without pills seeing as I stated, it&rsquo;s been a lot of work."	2-Nov-14
142138	Escitalopram	"I have had clinical depression for years and been on lots of SSRI&#039;s this medication Cipralex in UK works well with almost no side effects apart from sleepiness and weight gain. It does take a little longer to work but is worth it as I have always been sensitive to other SSRI&#039;s with lots of side effects. This one is great."	17-Jul-08
72103	Tramadol	"I  had severe constipation using tramadol once before so I&#039;am using a stool softener this time. I&#039;t works great for pain and moods"	23-Nov-14
63853	Sertraline	"Well I went to my Doctor and asked for medication for general anxiety and depression. I was prescribed Zoloft. I took it with a meal and about two how&#039;s later, I felt like I was having a heart attack as I had chest pain, racing  Pulse and palpitations. And I took my Blood Pressure and it was 140/90, Pulse 110. My usual Blood Pressure is 106/70, pulse 75. After about 6 hours, I began to feel OK again thank goodness. I will not be taking this medicine ever again. Going good back to my Doctor and asking for another medicine."	1-Sep-17
139048	Phentermine	"I started taking Phentermine in March 2009. So far I have lost 16lbs. Going from 191lbs to 175lbs has already made me feel so much better. I have a challenge from my Doctor to be down 20 more pounds by my next visit in late August. I&#039;m gonna do it. I am very happy that I got introduced to this medicine. I was never able to lose this much weight on my own. For me this drug had some insignificant side effects such as dry mouth and sweating a little more than usual, but these have disappeared with time. I have been stuck at 175lbs for quite a few weeks, because I need to step it up with the exercise. I am so excited for the future because this time I know that I&#039;m gonna make it."	20-Jun-09
72349	Tramadol	"I was in a head on collision and have 2 herniated disc, nerve damage in my neck and back, and rheumatoid arthritis. I was given Tramadol 50mg and it did nothing to my pain. I had to go to a pain management Doctor and he changed it to Percocets 10/325. I was on those for 2 yrs until I had to start taking 4 of them in the morning. I wouldn&#039;t take anymore during the day because I had other medicines to calm my pain. It was very easy for me to get off them because I didn&#039;t take them all day... just in the morning. Well I went back to my Doctor and I asked him about trying Tramadol again but maybe a higher dose. He put me on 100mg 4 times a day and let me tell you this medicine is wonderful. No side effects."	29-Dec-11
72330	Tramadol	"Yes, I have experienced a side effect of Ultram which is preventing me from sleeping. It has 50 mg 1 or 2 tablets every six hours as need. I have tried them from my doctor and I have been up all night, I had a total left knee replacement revision on the 8th of June, 2011. I was told also to take 1 Ambien (10 mg) and 1 extra strength Tylenol at the same time. I did and all I did was cat nap and was always awake when the daylight came up. I need REST!"	21-Jun-11
138938	Phentermine	"I lost 18 pounds in 6 weeks.  Exactly the boost I needed.  No side effects when discontinuing.  First couple of nights I had trouble sleeping through the night, but after 3rd or 4th day I had no trouble sleeping."	8-Nov-09
97330	Ambien	"Ambien is great for insomnia after years of not sleeping. Although I have experienced some mild hallucinations and have gotten up and moved things around in the dark inside my bedroom, while talking to someone I thought was there, but the sleep is worth the risk. I was miserable for to long."	10-Sep-09
34271	Tramadol	"I am taking this medicine for lower back pain due to herniated discs. Taking this drug in combination with Lyrica has reduced the pain in the front of my legs significantly."	6-Aug-08
127526	Phentermine	"I started using phentermine for the first time 3 days ago. I have zero appetite and trouble sleeping. Also dry mouth. This pill has given me tons of energy. I lost 120lbs over the past 4 years on my own. Since having two surgeries I put on around 25 to 30lbs. I started out Monday 8/14/17 weighing 166. I will see my Dr in a month. I am 5&#039;4 female and I&#039;m 33 years old my ideal weight by the Dr is between 108 and 145. I have been 166 lbs for a while and it doesn&#039;t look that great on me. I felt comfortable at 145 so that my goal. So that&#039;s about 20lbs that I need to loose."	16-Aug-17
96988	Ambien	"I take 5 or 10 mg depending on the day. I love this med. it shuts my mind off so i can sleep. I&#039;ve tried cutting out caffeine using allergy meds herbal type sleep aides and Tylenol pm....the crap doesn&#039;t work. Ambien is only thing that&#039;s worked and I&#039;ve never done anything dangerous or weird on it"	22-Aug-15
95895	Sertraline	"I am not the same person when I&#039;m off this medication, the difference is nearly night and day. I&#039;m so much happier, I have heaps more confidence, and all in all my life just works better when I&#039;m on it. I only came off it as a trial but I went back on after a month; I don&#039;t like the way I am without it I&#039;m irritable, and cry easily and obsess about everything! That has eased up so much and I am generally much happier and more able to get on with my life :)"	27-Oct-13
96258	Sertraline	"I can live again. Zoloft is a miracle medicine."	28-Feb-12
127930	Phentermine	"The first week I had to force my self to eat I didn&#039;t have a taste for anything but once I took my first bite I ate it all   Two meal a day big breakfast before pill  The second week it was self control    slight headaches from missing meals so don&#039;t skip meals   I drunk tea so I could use the bathroom   Ate high fiber foods and high protein foods  No sugar no drugs no alcohol no caffeine   don&#039;t drink alcohol with this medicine alcohol is a depressant and APEX gives you energy you are going to feel so weird plus alcohol is sugar it&#039;s empty Calories   I lose total of ten pounds in two weeks  I&#039;m going on my third week   Stay at 2000 -2500 calories per day   Drink water no snacking eat salad if you get the urge I&#039;m a medical student hopes this helps"	15-Nov-16
127551	Phentermine	"I just started on June 23rd. I was 224lb and I&#039;m 210lb now. But I&#039;m a bit worried. I&#039;m only on 15mg and I see much higher doses in these reviews. Maybe I will need a higher dose as time goes by. So far I&#039;m happy."	2-Jul-17
141871	Escitalopram	"It works great! after only 3 days I am beginning to feel the effects.  Unlike what is said for side effects, my sex drive is way back up where it should be (17 year old guy here), probably because the decrease in anxiety.  I feel a little loopy from it, and maybe a little more anxious feeling while I&#039;m adjusting, but the constant OCD worry and panic from anxiety is gone, and I feel like I can function way better and I feel kinda normal in public places like stores again. 9/10 only because of one nasty side effect:  INSOMNIA I love staying up but once in a while I need my deep sleep."	24-Jul-10
141935	Escitalopram	"I feel obligated to share my experience with Lexapro.  Before seeking psychiatric treatment, I&#039;d spend hours on this website (a well as others) reading reviews of Lexapro and similar SSRIs.  I suffer from GAD and Lexapro has helped tremendously.  The only downside was the side effects at first (unable to achieve orgasm, crazy dreams, extreme gas), but those have subsided.  My partner notices a complete turnaround in my stability.  I am very thankful for Lexapro.  I am so glad that I made it trough the first few weeks with the side effects.  This drug changed my life."	22-Nov-09
128704	Phentermine	"My initial weigh in was 175.0lbs and I am 5&#039; 7&quot;.  I have been on oral steroids for a herniated disc for almost a year.  Then new scans revealed two herniated disc, arthritis, and degenerative disc disease that now I am having steroid injections.   Well with all of these steroids I have put on a hefty 35lbs.  I was prescribed Phentermine 37.5mg for three months on 4/20/15.  I began taking them on 4/21/15 and with a combination of no appetite,  watching what I do eat, exercising...  I have lost 5.5lbs in five days!  I can&#039;t wait to get my old self back!  Hope everyone is doing just as well!"	26-Apr-15
140428	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve only been on it for a couple months but it seems to have kicked in. I distinctly remember the moment I felt it; it was a sort of euphoria that felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. After that, it definitely died down. It has helped with anxiety and agitation, but I don&#039;t feel like it has been doing anything in the way of depression. It&#039;s also flattened me out quite a bit in lieu of helping me feel more balanced. I&#039;m going to wait a little longer and then probably try something else."	26-Jun-17
71808	Tramadol	"Tramadol is not a very good pain medication nor is Ultram.  These two drugs did not work at all.      Stick to  Tylenol or Advil."	29-Aug-16
140696	Escitalopram	"I had been taken taking 10mg for 4 months before I realised it wasn&#039;t working cause things were still getting me down I told the physiologists and they both agreed and took it to 20 mg I found out the 20 mg were better cause I would double my 10mg when I missed one and I&#039;d end up with a dopey look on my face. But the 20mgs at first didn&#039;t feel like they were working but the side effects said other wise until my partner discovered taken them early so no side effects and less irratibility during the day and less irrational thoughts etc. Its been ok for me still hit rock bottom every blue moon e.g like y should I take these everyone else needs them not me , bla bla bla but I am still combating demons as well as understanding help ."	22-Oct-16
138806	Phentermine	"I am 25 years old.  I am 5&#039;11, and weighed 244lbs. Have used phentermine for about 4 months and have lost 40 pounds. I tried multiple diets and nothing worked. I lost about 6 pounds my first 2 weeks and then the next 3-4 pound a week on the next few weeks.  For me, the best way to take it was 1 hour before breakfast.  When I started to notice that my weight loss was slowing down, I would stop taking the pills for 2 weeks, and started them again.  This helps to get it going again, just be strict not to lose the healthy eating and exercise in that time.  Phentermine caused me some insomnia in the beginning but then it stopped.  Causes some dryness of the mouth but it&#039;s good because it makes you drink more water, which is great!"	26-Jun-10
64877	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been taking Solotik for 2 months now and what can I say, not effective at all !!"	5-Jun-15
64146	Sertraline	"Ok so this is my first review. I had been suffering from severe anxiety and panic attacks for about 5 months it completely changed my life for the worse. I stopped all the things I used to enjoy I didn&#039;t go to the gym and I wasn&#039;t physically active. I felt safe in my room not socialising as this did not cause me to panic. However it was a downward spiral from there. The reason that I felt safe at first was because my anxiety was from my heart beating fast and I was always aware of it ( weird right.) I wanted to avoid all things that would trigger my panic attacks. gotta cut it short so I took 50 mg zoloft and after the first day I haven&#039;t had one single panic attack and feel 10x better. I still have a little anxiety but only on my 5th day."	22-Jan-17
141358	Escitalopram	"Over the summer, I experienced my first panic attack leading to a string of additional panic attacks that followed. Subsequently, I was so overly focused on all the tics and aspects of my body, I was unable to focus or leave the house. I was getting panic attacks nearly on the daily, and had a terrible experience with the medication Viibryd, which gave me serotonin syndrome and left me awake for five straight days.   Lexapro gave me my life back. It took about 4 weeks to start to really help, and 2 months to work in full strength. It allowed me for the first time in years to truly be happy, and deal with the problems of life.   For those of you who just started this medicine, give it a chance because the side effects at first are very tough."	26-Oct-14
64062	Sertraline	"Started taking on a monday at 25mg upped on Thursday to 50mg feel 80 percent normal again first few days had nausea apart from that felt fine"	29-Jan-17
63924	Sertraline	"I was prescribed sertraline for severe anxiety nearly 3 weeks ago. The first 2 weeks were awful, felt so down and even more anxious, one day I felt ok, then the next horrific. I was on 50mg then upped to 100mg after 2 weeks. After 3 days of being on 100mg, I suddenly feel a lot better. I&#039;ve gone two days without no anxiety and generally feel a lot happier. No side effects apart from minor head aches. It&#039;s been so up &amp; down but I&#039;d recommend hanging in there until it settles :-)"	9-Jun-17
63985	Sertraline	"I attempted staying on sertraline 3 times before I could handle it. The first time I took it in the morning. Bad choice. I was in a fog, my thought process was extremely slow and was paranoid that those I interacted with might notice the slow thought process. You get a kind of headache as if you were injected with a numbing shot in the head. Not like anything I&#039;ve felt before. I had to give it a third shot after an embarrassing public anxiety attack. I never wanted to experience that again so stood my ground through side effects after reading reviews. So far I&#039;ve noticed less foggy side affects. Headaches seem to come around in the evening, but are manageable. I&#039;m a lot more relaxed. Moods are stable and positive. Anxiety is under control."	18-Jun-17
64573	Sertraline	"This medication has saved my life, I feel so relaxed on zoloft. Works extremely well for anxiety, panic disorders. Makes me drowsy but otherwise its great, I would recommend this."	2-Feb-16
64217	Sertraline	"My story; I hope it gives strength &amp; even though you feel like shit now with the RIGHT TREATMENT &amp; DOSE YOU WILL GET BETTER. In a nutshell; abusive relationship, court case &amp; bullying at work which resulted in me resigning. My &quot;genious&quot; GP thought it would be good for me to stop immediately my antidepressants (for anxiety). I got discontinuation syndrome. I fell into a deep depression &amp; felt mentally unstable reporting to A&amp;E twice. I was terrified &amp; spent weeks just lying on the floor to stop me topping myself (totally out of character). Sertraline was given to me 50mgs increasing by 25mgs every 6 weeks until I reached 200mgs. 252 days of hell... but within 2 days on 200mg I immediately felt a change &amp; hope - at last I was in recovery :)"	27-Nov-16

141253	Escitalopram	"I have always been an anxious person with major bouts of anxiety and OCD. But have always managed to keep it under control - except for a few months ago.  I had tried healthy eating, CBT, exercise, yoga, positive affirmations, acupuncture and more....nothing seemed to work for me.  Doctor suggested Lexapro and I was so so reluctant as I HATE the idea of antidepressants! And I wasn&#039;t even depressed!!!! :(  BUT - I started... 2.5mg at first. Then after one week upped to 5mg - which I am on now. PROS: Feel a lot better, sleep great, calm, no weight gain  CONS: Not much energy, little lack of sex drive.  I wanted to come off it first but PLEASE hang in there!! It actually works!  Goodluck and wishing you all the happiness that I have on Lexapro xxxx"	1-Mar-15
141312	Escitalopram	"To make my story short, I suffered from Generalized Anxiety Disorder and severe panic attacks in high school. After a couple of years of psychiatric help (no medicines at the time) I was able to live a complete free panic attack life for more than 13 years. Suddenly, after two important job transfers and a couple of personal set backs, the GAD returned along with severe panic attacks that led to the hospital a couple of times. Anxiety/Panic Attacks became so severe that I was simply not capable of performing my job nor having a social life and took a plane home thinking of quitting. Fortunately, I was convinced by my doctor to take Lexapro (10mg)... what a life changer. Positive effects began to kick in 3 to 4 weeks (activation symptoms did occur for 2 weeks)."	22-Nov-14
71820	Tramadol	"I am 25 and stuggle with RLS it is horrible! I&#039;m always tired barely sleep and am down alot due to lack of sleep. When I finish work I can&#039;t relax or unwind. I have tried everything! Tramadol are the ONLY thing that work for hours (A bath can last about 20 mins) They relax me and after about half an hour or so I dont have that horrible feeling in my legs.  If you have RLS try this it works wonders for me"	13-May-16
34175	Tramadol	"I have had fibromyalgia for about 10 years and Ultram really helped for the first 5 years. After that the effect started to decrease until they had to change me to something else because it is not a long term drug. I loved it because you could take it and there were no feelings of sluggishness. It just took the pain away. I wish I could still take it with the same relief as when I first started."	7-May-09
96215	Sertraline	"The obsessive compulsive disorder didn&#039;t diminish much for the first few months or so. However, it made me a less tense person, thus much more relaxed and joyful. Side effects were very mild, however all colors became more pronounced, greener grass, bluer sky, etc. Quite nice... Some hand tremor as well as occasional postural dizziness."	23-Jun-11
142075	Escitalopram	"I have had anxiety for over 14yrs. I have been using lexapro for 1 year it has kept me emotitionaly stable but it has not helped my anxiety at all. I use 40mg."	5-May-08
72117	Tramadol	"Its hard to believe something like this can exist yet when you go to a doctor with cut up arms &amp; hearing voices, scared out of your mind, obsessed about an idea as irrational as the empty tight feeling in your chest they give you a box of antidepressants. I have always been socially awkward &amp; use to cry allot as a kid, the day dreamer who enjoyed being alone except I didn&#039;t like being alone. Tramadol gives me around 6 hours of bliss, 6 hours of clear thoughts of what is in-front of me, its amazing. a cure to unhappiness, its a shame its difficult to get, I have been on it for a year and a half, 1 50mg pill every 3 days gives me the motivation to wake up.

128712	Phentermine	"I&#039;m 5&#039;5 starting weight 189 I started taking 37.5mg on 04/18 starting with half and alternating with whole and half pills each day. Serious dry mouth! But it really works I&#039;m not hungry, I&#039;ve been eating smaller and much much less. Snacking has was an issue for me but haven&#039;t touched cookies or snacks!!! I&#039;ve been drinking water only no desire for juice or soda The first two days I experienced headaches I believe were the lack of food/nutrients. But Monday and Tuesday I&#039;ve been taking women&#039;s multi-vitamins 1hr 1/2 to 2hrs before pill and headaches have gone. Already a night owl so this didn&#039;t help. But gives tremendous energy, so much so I don&#039;t even yawn throughout the day. I&#039;m going to weigh myself Saturday to see what I&#039;ve loss."	22-Apr-15
141908	Escitalopram	"I actually posted on here awhile back when I first started taking Lexapro. I have now been on 10 mg/day for four months. It definitely has cured my depression and irritability, but I always feel fatigued and I can&#039;t seem to lose the belly fat I acquired since being on Lexapro. My doctor insists this doesnot affect your metabolism or cause weight gain, BUT I am eating less (and better) than ever before, and exercising, and I can&#039;t lose any weight, where before, I could lose it pretty quickly with diet and exercise. I guess I&#039;m not really sure if it&#039;s the Lexapro or not, but I do feel tired and bloated all the time. I am a really small person (4&#039;11&quot;) and the belly fat really shows. Not sure what to do."	11-Mar-10
142091	Escitalopram	"not as effective as diazipam but as you probly know diazipam is for short term use only as it is very addictive unfortunatly."	26-Feb-08
138955	Phentermine	"I have been taking this medication with a doctor&#039;s supervision for a month now and have lost nearly 20 lbs! This is certainly a kick-start and I feel hopeful, having 80  more to take off. I do feel full and energized while taking it. I still have an appetite, but am able to control it much more successfully. I drink a lot of water and chew sugarless gum to help with the dry mouth issue. I have minimized my carbohydrate/red meat intake and eat much more fruit and veggies. No more diet soda/artificial sweetners. I do use small amounts of raw olive oil for vegetables and salads. I have also found that when dining out, I am now only eating half of the portion. I am a bit more irritable but will deal with it, so happy with the result!"	14-Aug-09
141903	Escitalopram	"This medicine worked extremely well to treat my anxiety disorder. It did not take long for the medicine to help me control the problems I was experiencing. I used 20mgs for about 4 and half years. The only thing that prevents this treatment from receiving a higher score are the side effects and withdrawal symptoms. The side effects I experienced were a definite decrease in sexual desire and a weight gain in my mid section. Personally I don&#039;t feel that any drug treatment is a permanent option, so when I decided to wean off of the drug I figured it would not have that great of an effect on me. Yet the withdrawal symptoms that I am currently experiencing are quite terrible. I am sure they will go away with time, but I could definitely do without."	28-Mar-10
128237	Phentermine	"I am a 42 year old woman, 5&#039;0&quot; and weigh 232lbs.  I am way too short to be this heavy. Severe depression over the years brought me to this weight.  Today is my first day on Aipex 37.5. I took 1/2 pill after having my morning smoothie.  I am doing Dr. Oz Day off Diet along with this.  So far so good I only felt a bit of a head rush but otherwise the energy is perfect. I&#039;m giving myself until January of next year to complete my full weight loss of 107lbs. I will be walking everyday as well. I will check in with updates every Monday. Hope I can help folks here as well."	22-Feb-16
72256	Tramadol	"I was prescribed  Tramadol to take together with Paracetamol for my chronic nerve pain. At first when I tried it, taking just one 50mg tablet it did almost nothing for me so I didn&#039;t bother taking it. Then later I tried taking 100mg together with Paracetamol and found it really helped and also improved my sense of well being, relaxation and general happiness. I take them only when necessary, and feel wary about taking it every day, because I&#039;ve read of serious addictions. I hope that taking it just three times a week will be fairly safe longer term."	11-Jul-12
64000	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been taking Zoloft for about half a year now on 200mg. I&#039;m not taking it for depression, it&#039;s being used in conjunction with other things for rage and anger, hypervigilence, as well as dissociation.  I&#039;ve been pretty lucky with this medication because I experience absolutely zero side effects, in fact I could probably take a higher dose right now although I&#039;d rather stick with the minimum and use coping techniques.  I still feel like &quot;me&quot; on Zoloft. In fact I feel more like myself then I have in a long time. I still feel my emotions and everything, although I experience them in a healthy, normal way. I don&#039;t experience all of the irrational, exaggerated, awful feelings and sensations I used to, in a good way.  I feel normal again."	19-May-17
127725	Phentermine	"Spent the last year eating very healthy and exercising with very little weight loss results. I got desperate last week and went to a weight loss clinic and got on Phentermine and B12 injections. Weighed in last Tuesday at 169.7lbs and went in for my one week check up and weighed 165.3 with jeans on and last time I was wearing shorts so I&#039;ve lost about 4.5 pounds in one week. You have to push through the first three days of jitteriness and insomnia and then it levels out and you feel normal. I have experienced some pretty gnarly dry mouth despite how much water I drink but it&#039;s worth it if these results keep up. I&#039;ll update again in a couple weeks!"	21-Mar-17
34384	Tramadol	"I was prescribed tramadol for my back pain.  It helped a little with the pain, but everytime I took it, it made me really sick the next day.  It made me nauseous, dizzy, and I kept vomiting the day after I took it.  Needless to say I quit taking it."	9-Mar-08
140567	Escitalopram	"I have been on Lexapro 10 mg for six weeks. I was really nervous to start, because I have never taken any type of medication before.  The first few weeks I did have side effects (including, nausea, dry mouth, and a kind of out of it feeling).  It worried me but I stuck it out to four weeks, because all of my medical friends insisted that I do. I am so glad that I did!  I feel so at ease about everything that used to control my mind excessively.  I am so much more bubbly and comfortable with conversations with others. It really just took that edge off for me. All of the side effects have gone away.  I strongly recommend."	24-Feb-17
97207	Ambien	"I&#039;ve been using 10mg Ambien for about 10 years now. I sleep very soundly and awake 6-8 hours later refreshed and loads of energy. Not every night, maybe 2 or 3 times a week. It is my miracle drug, but ONLY if I take it on an empty stomach! I too have had some &quot;amnesia&quot; like times. When I first began taking it, I called an ex boyfriend while my husband was asleep next to me. Thank God the side effects have gone away!"	16-Jul-10

64793	Sertraline	"Not trusting the source (s) of reviews of this medication from &#039;company-friendly&#039; sites, hope this one actually gets published.  Zoloft was a nightmare, nine-day experience.  Kept reading the &#039;keep taking it!&#039; reviews and those were simply not true to me.  Most everyone will eventually cycle back to feeling much better, especially if they have support.  Zoloft will push you over the edge if you keep taking it.  Had every side effect - bizarre urination flow, horrible gas, insomnia, etc.  Would suggest people considering Zoloft to stick with something short-term and short-acting.  Feel better and wean yourself off and don&#039;t let one quack doctor talk you out of that mindset."	18-Jun-15

It&#039;s so crazy. I barely am ever hungry and I get so full so fast. I do have dry mouth, but I drink a lot of water for it. My doctor said by eating good and exercise here and there I could loose up to 20 pounds in one month. Hopefully I&#039;ll be able to loose another 50 pounds by the next 3 months!"	25-Aug-15
78448	Allegra	"After about 4 years of terrible hay fever, lasting from about September to May, I have finally found my cure! I have tried countless allergy medications, including Zyrtec. None of them seemed to work until my doctor finally told me to try Allegra 180mg. I have not experienced any side effects, except I did have a sore throat about a week after starting Allegra. I definitely recommend this product."	2-Dec-14
71644	Tramadol	"I broke my knee, and all the cartilage came out of the back, I hate NARCOTICS,  having bipolar issues, as well, . Ultram is right in the middle, takes pain away , ENOUGH, so I don&#039;t have to concentrate on me!"	7-Sep-17
64173	Sertraline	"(Sertraline) is the most worst depression treatment for my son. The first time when my son had started to take these pills he was feeling normal but one day he started to have unusual pains which he couldn&#039;t describe in the chest which was everyday. Because of the pain he was going to A&amp;E for a check up twice in a week and shockingly nothing had came up. But that pain took my precious  sons life forever and I wish from that day on that he had never started these particular pills. So I want to warn you that you still have time so please don&#039;t make yourself regret the day u started to take these like my son edward."	16-Mar-17
72456	Tramadol	"I have severe scar tissue and adhesions from mutiple surgeries and the pain was intense it is in my pelvic area. I fill like I&#039;m having a bad cycle every day and walking intensifies the pain this is a every day feeling. My doctor tried me on Ultram and it has been a God send. I take it three times a day. Without it it would be hard to walk so I give it a 10 thank you."	24-Feb-12
71925	Tramadol	"I think this stuff works great as long as ur not a habitual user of the stronger pain killers. I&#039;m allergic to NSAIDs and aspirin so I can pretty much only take Tylenol and the occasional cox 2 inhibitor (Celebrex, vioxx, bextra). I took Tylenol and Celebrex yesterday for leg pains and got no relief. Used Tylenol today. No relief. I took a 50mg tramadol and pain gone!!! I have a high tolerance for certain meds but for pain, I&#039;m an over the counter kinda gal. This is great for single doses! Maybe not for daily regime :-/."	24-Nov-15

The situation was unreal I could not understand my thoughts , I failed Uni , and couldn&#039;t even concentrate in any activities .   I had to seek for help to continue to have a life , my Dr. Prescribed Zoloft same day I was  the old me , I could not believe I was scared to admit I was not weak but I was sick , best decision I ever made , I got my life back , using for 3 weeks only .do yourself a favour ask your Doctors about it . Good Luck"	18-Jun-15
65009	Sertraline	"I was put on a combination of sertraline and Xanax for panic disorder with agoraphobia. The physical symptoms were what troubled me the most: constant nausea, urge to go to the bathroom when outside the house, constant mild dizziness etc. The Xanax helped in the short term, although I tried to take it as rarely as possible. As for the sertraline, I noticed an increase in anxiety and mild panic attacks in the first week. After that, I started to feel much better. I&#039;m still nowhere near my &#039;usual&#039; self, but I&#039;ll see how the med works as more time passes."	5-Feb-15
140500	Escitalopram	"I have been taking lexapro for 3 months now and I have definitely seen a noticeable difference as have my coworkers. I am taking a very small dose, only 5mg, and I am 5&#039;5 120lbs. I was prescribed it after talking to my doctor about the anger and anxiety I had been feeling. I would get so angry about small things and even though I could tell I was being ridiculous I couldn&#039;t stop myself. I felt like it was affecting my relationship and productivity at work. Although it has not completely gone away and I still feel like I struggle from depression, I have been told by people that I seem happier and I haven&#039;t felt such anxiety that I can&#039;t focus on anything else in awhile."	8-Nov-16
64625	Sertraline	"I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. I&#039;m 33 years old and have a son. I would panic everytime he wasn&#039;t with me. I would think of the craziest &quot;what ifs&quot; that could happen. I got to the point I couldn&#039;t even drive on the highway because I might get into an accident. I was prescribed zoloft at 25mg for six weeks...I felt nauseous for a couple days but was fine. Then I was put up to 50mg for another six weeks. I was really tired and my anxiety spiked but I stuck it out. Now I&#039;m on 100mg. Have been for 2 weeks. Not a single anxiety attack. I feel less tired but still get sleepy through out the day. My son can be at school, out swimming or doing other kid things and my mind doesn&#039;t head straight to horrible what if thoughts. Yay!!"	10-Dec-15

71680	Tramadol	"My new Doctor tried to take me off tramadol and prescribed something else, additionally went to a one star rehab center with my bag of medication they didn&#039;t give me all of my medication back and short-changed me a full bottle of tramadol.

96817	Ambien	"I took generic ambien (not the CR) for just two consecutive nights. While it does work for putting me to sleep and keeping me asleep, I have to say I would not recommend this to people.  Just take benadryl or Advil PM.      The reason I say this is because it affected (and days later is still affecting) my memory.  I am told by a few friends and co-workers of things I did or said (during the daylight hours, work hours) and I honestly don&#039;t remember any of it!      So for me... I won&#039;t take this again just because it scares me. I&#039;m sharp as a tack, I remember and observe everything so this really shocked me."	27-Oct-16
72218	Tramadol	"I&#039;ve been on everything to control my restless legs syndrome- most recently switched from 2mg of ropinirole (Requip) to 50mg tramadol. So far so good - the Requip had worked well for the restless legs syndrome, but left me feeling nauseous and just kind of icky all the time, and I never felt clear-headed the next day. So far, I&#039;ve awakened feeling much more refreshed with the tramadol, but I don&#039;t believe the 50mg dose will be adequate, as I&#039;ve woken up each night around 3 am with symptoms.  For the past few nights I&#039;ve dosed at 100mg and have slept great.  Good stuff."	9-Sep-13

214559	Escitalopram	"For me and other people I have suggested this medication too it has completely changed our lives for the better. Reading reviews you often see knee jerk reactions from people suffering deeply and then taking the medication and going through the up to 4 week period of feeling worse. That is a tough 4 weeks if you felt you where already at breaking point, easy to pull out the pitch fork at that time.  But you&#039;re less likely to hear from the people who would tell you the polar opposite of that because once taking lexapro providing you are feeling better it&rsquo;s easy to leave the dark world behind and return to the light.   My suggestion to anyone who has been recommended this, ignore stigma and try this for at least 4 weeks at your doctors direction. GL ML"	17-Oct-17

I&#039;m relaxed, I haven&#039;t been able to put an outfit together in almost a year. I didn&#039;t know I had a generalized anxiety disorder.

After being off it for 5 years or so, my daily anxiety gradually started creeping back into my life until I reached a point last year where I would have horrible panic attacks everyday. I&#039;ve been on 75 MG a day for the past 7 months and I feel better than I have in years! It took a while to find the correct dosage for me, but once I have it&#039;s been amazing. Along with the Zoloft I also take 15 MG Buspar daily and Lorazepam as needed."	29-Aug-13

140623	Escitalopram	"My rheumatologist put me on Lexapro for both depression &amp; fibromyalgia, after Cymbalta stopped working for me. I started it two weeks ago Tuesday &amp; I absolutely love what it&#039;s doing for my depression &amp; anxiety but hate that it&#039;s caused me to gain at least 5 lbs already. I&#039;m going to try to stick with it for another 4-6 wks, but if my weight continues to increase, I&#039;ll have to wean off of it. I dread weaning off of antidepressants."	19-Dec-16

I have been on Zoloft 200mg for the past couple of years and it&#039;s working pretty well.  Lately , I have noticed I can&#039;t remember anything.  I hadn&#039;t thought about Zoloft being the culprit because I&#039;ve been on it so long with no problems.  I have never kept a journal, with side effects, likes, dislikes of drugs, but I think its time to start one.  I&#039;d like to hear others&#039; experiences with this medicine, or other &quot;popular&quot; ones. "	29-Oct-10
72061	Tramadol	"I have been on just about every antidepressant you can name. They started giving me bad side effects like constipation so I had to stop taking them. For about two years I could hardly get out of bed in the morning, I was suffering from severe depression and had absolutly no motivation to do anything. I had gotten tennis elbow and the doc put me on tramadol. Within a couple days not only did it help with the pain but I started feeling my depression lifting as well as my motivation. I told the doctor it was working great for my depression so he kept me on it. I take 150 mg a day. I no longer sleep all day and have even decided to go back to school. It helps with not only my motivation and depression it helps me concentrate. I love it! "	28-Apr-15

As far as side effects go, I&#039;ve experienced slight headaches in the temple areas but they don&#039;t linger, this morning (9/14/15) I had extremely dry mouth but it was cured with water, I always have a burst of energy when I take it yet i&#039;m still able to take a nap before work while on the medication.

Unable to function, I couldn&#039;t breathe, or drive myself to and from work without having an attack. My Doctor put me on 10 mg Lexapro, and all of that stopped.  Have not had a problem with that since. I was absolutely exhausted and numb, though.  I have also gained around 20 pounds, and no libido at all.  My Doctor cut me down to 5 mg, and I took myself down after a couple of weeks to none.  Probably not the smartest move.  Now have dizziness to the extreme and some headaches, but I&#039;m determined to get drug free if possible."	9-Aug-10
141683	Escitalopram	"I have severe anxiety and panic attacks. I have been on Lexapro about 4 different times. I never learn my lesson.  After 6 months or so I think I am doing good enough to wean myself off and within 6 months I am back in the ER with a severe panic attack. I should just stay on it. This time around I started on 5mg and then bumped it to 10mg after 3 days. I am on day 2 of 10mg. I finally feel some relief. I have not left my house in a week- trapped due to panic attacks and today I was able to walks dogs and go to the store. Thank God there is something like Lexapro out there or else I would surely be in a mental institution."	30-Dec-12
141839	Escitalopram	"I started a course of Lexapro around eight months ago. I suffer from major depression so I started out using 5mg, then up to 10mg and then 20mg. At first I felt a slight feeling of nausea that only lasted a few minutes. The other side effects I experienced were slight mania and decreased appetite. It helped me remain calm during pressure at work. I am now weening off escitalopram and am experiencing involuntary muscle contractions whilst entering sleep beyond R.E.M. I also find myself chomping my jaw sometimes and am having cold and flu symptoms along with an unusual head rush that left me a little bit disorientated. I am on my final days of escitalopram now, and I&#039;m sure side effects will diminish soon."	26-Jul-11
140524	Escitalopram	"I took it on first day 10 mg ! Shaking of body , confusion , vomited 4 times , feeling sick , can&#039;t talk as much through mouth due to confusion . Burning sensation in body , passing out . Etc ! Don&#039;t take it if it&#039;s worse"	17-Jan-17
64205	Sertraline	"This pills are horrible!!! Stomach pain is extremely strong!!! I wake-up in the middle of the night with shortness of breath and tachycardia. I feel more depressed! Very Tired, sleepy, drowsiness, nausea &amp; so much more."	7-Dec-16
141011	Escitalopram	"I was suffering with panic disorder with agoraphobia for 10 years.  It started off pretty innocuous,  a few trips to the ER, calling out of work... As my symptoms got worse I became more and more housebound.  Going ANYWHERE, even a trip to the supermarket was miserable.I couldnt take my kids to the park.I had to quit my job because of the distance and panic attacks. I loved to travel but I could no longer get on a plane, forget getting to the airport.  I literally tried everything. Finally I cracked.  my doc prescribed me lexapro. I was so scared but so desperate.  It has completely given me my life back. Slowly, surely, persistently I began to drive again. 2 years later I am me again. Fight through the side effects. Don&#039;t waste your life."	31-Jan-16
97167	Ambien	"I have worked rotating shifts for over the 30 years and I have never had enough sleep. So I asked my doctor if there was anything I could try. He suggested Ambien, 10 mg at bedtime. So for the last year I now wake up after 6 hours of rest, which nothing compared to years of restless nights tossing and turning over to look at a clock. Good sleep means a lot and is worth a pill every night."	7-Jul-12
139129	Phentermine	"I started Adipex on 10/23 and by 10/28 I lost 5 pounds so I am impressed with it already. Now I want to start getting some exercise and see what I can really do.    Now after 2 weeks, I still have had no time to exercise and I loosely follow a 1500 calorie diet. Beginning weight 217 lbs and current weight 202 lbs. "	6-Nov-08
141224	Escitalopram	"I noticed pretty good results within two weeks- my general anxiety lowered significantly, but I still get frequent panic attacks."	30-May-15
128647	Phentermine	"I took the first pill today (4/17/15) and within 30 minutes I felt as if I just walked out of an Olympic sized pool that I&#039;ve been walking in my whole life. I&#039;m super alert and my hearing even perked up. Wow! I generally don&#039;t like taking meds that make me &quot;feel&quot; different but this is a reaction I can appreciate. I feel like I&#039;m plugged in right now. Like my metabolism switch was turned back to &quot;teen&quot;! I&#039;m looking forwards to the weight loss and weening off the med and maintaining better eating habits and exercise...for life."	17-Apr-15
141252	Escitalopram	"I was put on Lexapro for 6 months as a trial after having a major anxiety attack (my first one ever) to see how my anxiety would change. I was prescribed 20mg. Because I have never been on medication in my life and heard these things can be highly addicting I took it upon myself (and with the approval of my Dr) to only take 10MG for the duration of the trial period. I definitely feel it helps with anxiety in the short-term. I gained 40lbs, especially in my belly area and head HORRIBLE heart burn. I also had dizzy spells once in a while. I would not count on any meds for long-term. I recommend change in lifestyle than to suffer from side effects of meds. The good almost doesn&#039;t outweight the bad."	2-Mar-15
138994	Phentermine	"I have taken Adipex since February 2009.  I am a 41 year old, 5&#039;6&quot; female.  When I started taking Adipex, I weighed 187 pounds.  By August, I weighed 150 pounds, which was my initial goal.  I now weigh 143 pounds!  Most of my clothes are now sizes 6 &amp; 8.  I feel great.  Adipex has changed my life.  It was super simple to do."	3-Sep-09
96250	Sertraline	"I was suffering from depression and anxiety for as long as I could remember, but never sought treatment. My family has always been against relying on any sort of psychiatric drugs and believe in willpower as a medicine. Eventually, my condition got so bad, that I knew I had to do something about it. Zoloft saved my life! I feel like myself again and my rationality and naturally positive outlook have returned to me. Plus I haven&#039;t gained a pound! The only really negative side effect is reduced sex drive. This can also be due to hormonal birth control. I have also had very vivid dreams since going on Zoloft (50mg). That, I&#039;m not complaining about. Amazing medication!"	8-Mar-12
127601	Phentermine	"I started Adipex-p on May 10 weighing 292 pounds. It&#039;s now May 19 and so far I&#039;ve lost 9 pounds! I definitely feel like I have more energy and I have more of an endurance when doing cardio. It seems like I&#039;ll drop a couple of pounds and then stay level for a couple of days and drop again. So far my only side effect is dry mouth so I&#039;m thirsty all the time. Can&#039;t wait to see what the rest of the month brings!   5&#039;6&quot;  5/9/17 292 5/19/17 283"	19-May-17
138990	Phentermine	"I have been on Adipex for about 2 months. Started out at 262 pounds. At my 1 month check up I weighed 249 so I lost 13 pounds in the first month. It&#039;s a few days before my second check up and I weigh 239 pounds so I only lost 10 pounds this month. I feel stuck at my new weight.. So I need to change something about my exercise or my eating. I really feel like this medicine is great for anyone with a weight problem. Looking in the mirror I see a whole new person. I set my goal to high and I think that&#039;s what&#039;s causing me to feel like it isn&#039;t good enough. I had a friend who lost 80 pounds in 3 months on Adipex. So I guess it&#039;s about determination. So I&#039;m back to the gym. I want to get down to 150 pounds. Where I haven&#039;t been in 7 years!"	6-Sep-09
141063	Escitalopram	"I have been dealing with general and situational anxiety disorder and panic attacks on and off since college.  Tried Paxil and Prozac. Paxil made me gain 20 lbs. and Prozac increased my anxiety.  Lexapro works.  My advice: Try taking Lexapro for at least one week. The first week you will feel tired, dizzy, and mildly nauseated. Those effects disappear very quickly.  Do start at 5mg and slowly increase to 10 or 20mg. Ask you doctor to supplement with Buspar XL which counteracts most Lexapro side effects and further helps control anxiety and panic attacks. I don&#039;t recommend using Lexapro without Buspar.  Anxiety/Panic will gradually disappear over two to four weeks.  Use Ativan or other Benzodiazapines sparingly until Lexapro is working."	17-Sep-15
128320	Phentermine	"I started phentermine on 10/28 at 318 lbs. I was miserably depressed and my weight had spiraled out of control after getting married and having a baby. I had tried to lose and I found it nearly impossible. With phentermine, I have energy and my appetite is very controlled. I limit my carb intake and eat 1400 calories per day.  I work out 3-5 times per week and my endurance has greatly improved and there is a huge difference in the way I feel. I have lost 33 lbs in 7 weeks.  I expect to lose 10 lbs per month and I am very satisfied with that.  No side effects to speak of.  I am very happy my doctor prescribed this for me!"	16-Dec-15
72212	Tramadol	"Takes care of my chronic knee pain. Due to cancer, I am not a candidate for a replacement at this time, though I am need of them. Tramadol keeps me from suffering. I usually take 2 daily, prescription is for 4 daily. I up it to three if I have a day where I am very active. Everything has side effects and I can live with Tramadol. I like that I can drive and go to work while taking it."	20-Sep-13
139147	Phentermine	"I started using Adipex March 08 weighing in at 332lbs. As of September 08 now 284lbs. Lost 48lbs in 6 months. At first had a little trouble going to sleep but that went away after a coule of weeks. I think that the pill is totally worth it. Now I have REALLY picked up my exercise routine and I am now very cautious about what I eat. Very little starch at all. Exercise consists of 3-4 miles on treadmill at 6-7 mph then 30-45 minutes in a sauna EVERY DAY. I would suggest taking the pill for 2-3 weeks then laying off for a week. This is what has worked for me."	15-Sep-08
97196	Ambien	"I started taking Ambien for insomnia about a month ago. It works great if I am able to take it early enough to get in 8 hours of sleep...however...I also take Wellbutrin and apparently they do not work well together. I have been sleep eating, sundaes, brownies, yogurt, sandwiches. I also cook and leave the mess behind and don&#039;t remember ANY OF IT. I colored my hair with two colors, and gave myself the worst haircut I&#039;ve ever had in my life and was totally shocked the next morning when I saw the bright pink color in my hair and awful short bangs and uneven length. I had a conversation with my daughter and gave her permission to spend the night out which I would NOT have done in my right mind and she made me write it down for proof!"	14-Oct-10
127556	Phentermine	"I have lost about 30lbs, and gained muscles in the last 8 months while working out 3 days a week. The last 5 months I&#039;m down about 20 inches also. I do have to take it by no later than 9am so that it doesn&#039;t affect my sleep. It&#039;s best to take this as soon as you wake up. If you take it later in the morning or noon it will mess with your sleep! The dry mouth issues went away for me around 3-4 months."	28-Jun-17
128341	Phentermine	"I am 21, 5ft .5in female and I got to my heaviest point, weighing in at 155.2. I have never been more than 130. I tried weight watchers and I worked out for about 45-1hr every day and nothing was helping...anyway, I went to my dr and he said he felt I reached a plateau, where it was very hard for me to lose the weight. I was proscribed Adipex tablets on 11/17/15 and today, 12/1/15, I am down 11.2lbs. That is 11.2lbs in exactly 2 weeks!! After losing about 5lbs I felt so much better already. I have not had any horrible side effects. I have dry mouth if I don&#039;t drink much and I barely ever eat anything. I have to force myself to eat. Other than that, I have nothing bad to say about it. I definitely would recommend it! Will update in 2 weeks!"	2-Dec-15
128046	Phentermine	"I started on Phentermine on June 7, 2016 at a weight of 235#. I am 5 feet 7.5 inches tall. The only side effects I have experienced are a dry mouth and increased energy (a good thing).  In the first three weeks I lost 15 pounds. Then the weight loss slowed a little. It took three weeks to lose the next ten pounds. My target weight is 180#, a loss of 55#, so I am about half way there. My plan is to take 90 days of Phentermine, then discontinue for 90 days to figure out how to sustain the weight loss without the help of an appetite suppressant. After 90 days I will resume taking Phentermine until I reach my target weight. I have never felt more optimistic about losing weight and keeping it off."	26-Jul-16
141204	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve been on lexapro for 4 days now, and I&#039;m honestly feeling so much better. I read in some reviews that some of you guys experienced nausea, and I fortunately didn&#039;t. I just feel better. And I hope that as the time goes by my anxiety fades away even more."	26-Apr-15
128785	Phentermine	"I started phentermine right before thanksgiving.  I am 5&quot;2&#039; and starting weight was 184lbs.  It made me not hungry at all.  I constantly drank water and ate very lightly.  No insomnia first month.  I lost 17 pounds.  Second month I had to take 3 days off because of the insomnia.  If I feel I can&#039;t sleep I will skip a day or two.  Still only drinking water and eating lightly.  No exercise at all and today I weigh 156lbs.  Total loss of 28lbs in two months.  This month I plan to add exercise to drop more weight. Love Phentermine!"	30-Jan-15
72134	Tramadol	"I am prescribed this for chronic neck/shoulder pain. My doctor gave me this instead of a straight narcotic, Tramadol 50mg tabs 2 or as needed 3 x a day. I also take Lexapro 25mg 1xday. Just using Lexapro erased my depression symptoms, after starting tramadol. I find I am hugely motivated at work, I have a fairly physical job and it can be draining but with this not only is the pain controlled my mood is &quot;Mr. work&quot;. It really makes me more productive and happy able to get up in the morning without the hangover of Percocet. Much more alert and able to tackle heavy work that guys 15 years younger whine about. Highly recommended."	9-Oct-13
142031	Escitalopram	"Ecellent medication for depression, although weight gain can be a problem. I have found it to be the only medicine that can assist me with little or no side effects. Been on it for two years."	10-Dec-08
141911	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve only been on Lexapro (10mg) for 4 days and already I&#039;m a little worried. I am experiencing extreme dizziness and nausea to where I think I&#039;m going to pass out. The good news is I&#039;m not as depressed. The bad news? I&#039;m not exactly happy either. I am a complete zombie. I don&#039;t care about anything. I cannot concentrate. I find myself &quot;zoning out&quot; during the day, like I&#039;ve mentally checked out. The second night I took my medicines I had an anxiety attack as well, and my depression slammed me pretty hard. My suicidal thoughts were worse during the attack and I did some serious damage to myself. I&#039;m sure this works for some people, but I&#039;m going to give it a month and if there is no improvement with these side effects I&#039;m switching."	2-Mar-10
72490	Tramadol	"I an allergic to all opiates. I have suffered for years with a fractured l4 and now a knee replacement. Without tramadol I could not get my work done.  This really works."	18-May-11
142079	Escitalopram	"I&#039;m a 46 yr old female with a long history of being a control freak, unable to sleep, edgy, irritable, etc.  I&#039;ve been using 10mg of Lexapro for about 5 weeks now and the results are amazing.  I can sleep, I can focus on what&#039;s important, and I&#039;m much more even tempered.  All my close friends and my boyfriend have commented on the difference.  I haven&#039;t seen any side effects that I can&#039;t deal with yet, in fact the best one is that it makes me sleepy, so I take it at night."	9-Apr-08
141642	Escitalopram	"For me Lexapro is a very effective medication for both depression and anxiety in the form of excessive worrying.  I&#039;ve always said this medication was &quot;smooth&quot;, trying to indicate that it produced no sudden or worrisome side effects.  I&#039;ve taken Lexapro by itself many years ago and now it has been added to my current medications for bipolar II-mixed, anxiety, and lately for severe depression."	1-Mar-12
128808	Phentermine	"Fastin has helped me lose 10lb. I started off with a half a pill and not doing full pills so my heart and body could get used to it. All I can say is I love this diet pill. REALLY HELPED ME."	7-Dec-14
64154	Sertraline	"I suffer from depression and has got to a very low point.  Doc prescribed me Sertraline.  First day, I didn&#039;t sleep.  Second day I had a tight chest and palpitations.  Third day, I had a fuzzy head.  Since then, it&#039;s been great.  I actually feel joy and am so much happier.  Give it a chance, I felt negative in the first three days but it takes time to work."	18-Jan-17
63933	Sertraline	"I started on Zoloft after suffering from anxiety for about 2 years. I had irrational fears about my health (heart attack, brain tumor, etc.) even though I am only 24 years old and healthy, and I found that anything out of my ordinary routine caused anxiety. I started on Zoloft at 25mg with a plan to increase my dose to 50mg after 1 month. I was a little dizzy the first week on the medicine, but since then have noticed no side effects. I noticed my anxiety starting to disappear after about 3 weeks, and I decided I didn&#039;t need to increase my dose. Still on 25mg per day 6 months later, and it has changed my life. I was skeptical of medication to begin with but highly recommend this, it really works!!"	3-Jun-17
139193	Phentermine	"I have been taking Adipex P for 3 mouths and I have lost 30 pounds.  I only take half a pill in the morning. It works very well."	26-Jul-08
141280	Escitalopram	"Switched from Lexapro to generic escitalopram. Big mistake. Suicidal after 3 weeks. No problems for many years prior."	24-Mar-15
96021	Sertraline	"Zoloft has been a life saver! I have been on this medicine for about 7 years now. Two kids (3 and 6 months) later I still have to use this medicine, and it works miracles. My husband deployed to Afghanistan and I do not think I could of made it through that time while taking care of our kids without this medicine. The only side effects I had were loss of appetite, tired, and mild headaches but that only lasts about a week. If your just starting this medicine hold on I promise this will help you feel like you again!"	11-Oct-12
138913	Phentermine	"I started taking this medicine 03/08/10 at 215lbs..today is 04/14/10 and I am at 195lbs! Total loss of 20lbs in a little over a month.  I have been watching my calorie intake around  1000-1200 a day...and exercise at least 4-5 times a week (30-45 minutes each workout). During Easter I ate Easter dinner with the family and believe in having what I call my &quot;cheat day&quot; once a week.  I avoid fast food @ all cost excluding Subway and Wendy&#039;s where I can eat delicious low fat/low calorie food. One of my biggest weaknesses is sweet tea...I have switched from regular sugar to Splenda and I have adjusted well to the change. This medicine works, it helps me keep focused on my goal..30-40 more lbs to go!"	14-Apr-10
64094	Sertraline	"I didn&#039;t really notice any side affects too bad. More like bad sleeping habits (waking up at 2 am and not going back to sleep for two hours) and I also had nightmares quite frequently for two weeks. But I&#039;ve been taking it for 6 weeks now for depression and anxiety, and I feel great. I have so many more good days than I used to. I&#039;m not down as often."	20-Mar-17
128730	Phentermine	"Am in UK.... PHENTERMINE is not a national health prescription drug,  so I have had to get mine through a slimming and diet clinic.   Started at 24 St 9 lbs....  My doctor weighs and takes my blood pressure every 2 weeks..  After 2 weeks,  lost 19 lbs,  after 4 weeks lost another 7lbs, after 6 weeks lost another 9lbs.   Lost 2.5 stone so far and feeling great apart from constipation.   I am taking favored.   I also get prescribed a water tablet and a multi vitamin.   I pay &pound;84 every 4 weeks which may seem a bit steep but I feel it&#039;s worth it...."	31-Mar-15
141296	Escitalopram	"During a recent stretch of terrible anxiety which  crept up very slowly, I suddenly became incapacitated. I was in fear of everything and I couldn&#039;t function- AT ALL. I went to my doctor and explained the symptoms and he recommended Lexapro 10 mg. with Klonopin .5 mg. as needed. I took both medications and the Klonopin erased all the startup side effects of the Lexapro such as increased nervousness, insomnia, and poor appetite. As soon as the Lexapro kicked in, ( about three weeks) I was able to step off the Klonopin and have felt great ever since. Anxiety has been wiped out and sleep has improved. I feel 100% better. Don&#039;t give up, this medication WORKS !!"	19-Dec-14
72233	Tramadol	"Been using naproxen almost daily for years, for back and hand related near chronic pain-partially due to inflammation and swelling.  Had to stop taking ALL NSAID&#039;s on orders from my GI Dr.   USED 3,000mg daily ACETAMENOPHEN FOR 3 MONTHS-much less effective than min dose naproxen had been for pain and useless for inflammation/swelling  (using large doses of omega 3/fish oil for inflammation.)  Started tramadol about 2 weeks ago, noticed difference over acetamenophen alone in the first 2 days while taking 25mg at a time and still ramping up to 4x daily.  Now I take it every 6 hours, and if I miss a dose-especially the last one at night-significant pain and stiffness returns. Hope to switch to extended release version."	13-Jul-13
34375	Tramadol	"I have been taking tramadol for about 3 years for restless leg syndrome. My doctor tried several other drugs for this and all they did was enhance the problem. Took my first two tramadol and had the best nights sleep I have had in years."	28-Apr-08
142113	Escitalopram	"I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and was given Lexapro along with cognitive therapy. The first week Lexapro made me worse than I was originally. However, it worked wonders and has helped me immensely to get my life back in order.  I started on a light dosage at 10mg and in 4 weeks jumped to 20mg which is typical.  This combined with cognitive therapy has got me back on track.  I really didn&#039;t experience any side effects except feeling crappy when I first got on it.  Within 4 weeks it was fine.  To me it is like taking aspirin everyday now."	16-Feb-09
64584	Sertraline	"I was put on Zoloft a few years ago when I became very depressed (I also have anxiety and have had it pretty much my whole life which made it worse) and I&#039;ve been on it ever since. I feel much better now about myself and my perspectives on things however I don&#039;t know if it was from the drug, time or therapy especially because I was finally feeling more in control of myself and my thoughts last year. So if it was Zoloft then it took a while for it to kick in for me I guess ? My doctor did say that in some patients it does nothing and in others it does so who knows ! However whether It&#039;s working for me or not I feel good right now and it&#039;s not having any long term side affects on me so I can stay on as long as I want "	23-Jan-16
64917	Sertraline	"It took a little while to get the dosage right because I took it slow but now I have improved so much! I did 50mg for a month, 100mg for a month and finally 150mg a month. I have my life back! My anxiety and panic is no longer crippling."	30-Mar-15
140864	Escitalopram	"Escitalopram has helped me tremendously with panic and anxiety! Want to give hope to others who&#039;ve been combing forums as I have. Started having panic attacks 6 months ago for no apparent reason. Waited it out hoping they would stop, but only worsened and my life went downhill fast. Dr. gave me Escitalopram 10 mg. with Clonazepam to help with start up effects. The first 10 days were difficult: insomnia, loss of appetite, increased anxiety. These effects disappeared as I hoped and each day I noticed subtle improvements. I am now panic free! Still have small anxiety, but that is human and &quot;normal&quot;.  So happy that I took action, as I was very afraid. Give this med a chance and give it time to work. I&#039;m sure glad that I did!"	4-Apr-16
127729	Phentermine	"I started taking phenyermine 37.5 on March 5, 2017.   I am 28 with 3 kids. I&#039;ve had trouble losing weight from my last pregnancy which was over 3 years ago. I&#039;m very short so any little amount of weight on me looks like a lot compared to taller or even average height women.   My goal is to lose at least 60 lbs.   so far I have lost 10 lbs. 6 of those lbs were lost in the very first week of taking this.   I don&#039;t eat much and I definitely need to work on water intake but I only drink water. I exercise and walk often."	21-Mar-17
72060	Tramadol	"I&#039;ve tried a variety of prescribed medications for about 8 years. The ones that had worked (ie: gabapentin), had stopped working after a few months. Others made me feel sluggish and hungover. I started taking tramadol 6 months ago, 100mg in the mornings. My days are so much better, I feel energize, and it takes 90% of fms pain away. I cannot take Tramadol at night as it makes me have nightmares, and insomnia. Great if taken in the morning. My father and brother also take it for different ailments, they swear by it."	28-Apr-15
141795	Escitalopram	"A traumatic incident about six months ago prompted me to seek counseling.  I was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and later depression (because of the PTSD), and after three months of appointments I finally decided to give Lexapro a try.  I&#039;m definitely not a pill person, so I was hesitant. I don&#039;t like side effects, especially nausea.  I was happy to find that the side effects were fairly mild, but my dose was also pretty mild [5mg].  I did have one really intense headache within the first few weeks, but I can&#039;t absolutely attribute that to the medicine.  Before I started taking the medicine, I was miserable (no sleep, sad, angry, etc.).  Lexapro has helped make my life more manageable.  It feels good not to be a zombie anymore."	21-Jan-11
64974	Sertraline	"My entire life I have had problems with severe anxiety, panic attacks, depression and portion control. (In other words I ate to make myself feel better). I was not overweight.  I also would have Obsessive compulsive disorder thoughts for days, weeks, years about events that did not even matter.   After taking Zoloft for two months all of my conditions as listed above has ceased to exist. I do not feel the need to eat all the time, I do not have OCD thoughts anymore, depression, anxiety, etc. has disappeared.  It honestly brings me to tears thinking about suffering like I have for the past 22 years.  Thank you, Zoloft."	20-Jan-15
140953	Escitalopram	"42 year old male.  Married with 2 kids.  No drugs or alcohol.  No history of anxiety or depression prior to this incident.  Several months ago I was wrongly diagnosed with throat cancer.  As it turns out I am fine and cancer free.  But the fear of leaving my family without a husband/father sent me into a tail spin filled with anxiety and depression.  The worst part is that I stopped sleeping.  My MD put me on Xanax (.5mg) and Ambien (10mg) which only made things worse.  Finally went to shrink who put me on 10 mg Lexapro that I take in the morning.  The Lex has given me the strength to get off the other 2 meds completely.  After 1 month she bumped me up to 20 mg.  After 6 weeks anxiety gone, depression gone, and I&#039;m sleeping again naturally"	7-Mar-16
127849	Phentermine	"I started taking the pill for obesity Nov. 28th  weighing 433 and by Dec. 18th I weighed in at 415. Today is Dec 28th and I&#039;m at 409. I&#039;m loving this pill, feeling and my new scale (Ozeri Precision Pro Max). My Doctor recommended the pill because of my obesity and high blood pressure. When I first started taking this pill I had slight chest pains as I&#039;m only taking half of the 37.5 tablet I was prescribed. I was a lot jittery and I had nightmares so I stopped taking them for a week and then got back on them the next week. Now I&#039;m fine, no chest pains and I have a lot of energy when I&#039;m active and at the gym, but my energy is low when I take them and don&#039;t workout. Overall, I&#039;m happy with the results, I&#039;m eating better, and looking better."	29-Dec-16
141928	Escitalopram	"I am a 49-year old female and have been on Lexapro for about 7 months.  I can&#039;t believe how much it has changed my life - I am so happy now!  I take 5 MG per day (1/2 a pill) - more than that at once upsets my stomach.  I had tried Paxil before and it was awful.  Lexapro has given me my life back."	6-Jan-10
139267	Phentermine	"I weighed 219 lbs when I started taking it 23 days ago and I have lost 11 pounds. My goal is to lose 25-30 lbs. My energy level has never been better. Overall this has been positive."	29-May-08
96223	Sertraline	"Helped with anxiety but made me hungry all the time (no other side effects) but I was able to sleep well while taking it."	6-Jun-11
64391	Sertraline	"Was on 50mg sertraline for anxiety it helped heaps socially and was able talk away easily to people with out getting sweating hands and nervous etc.  I found if i took anymore then 50 I couldnt sleep. It hasn&#039;t helped at all with other anxiety issues though which was the main reason I got put on them but they did benifit me socially alot"	4-Sep-16
141414	Escitalopram	"Lexapro really surprised me. It help so much with my depression and compulsive disorders. I mean before, I could even function with my life or at work. I was extremely paranoid and didn&#039;t want to socialize at all. I&#039;ve been on for 1 Week, and I can tell you I feel more confident and social. I&#039;m more relax and see life brighter than what I saw before. I shouldn&#039;t had to wait 26 years to finally be happy. I currently taking 10mg. At first the medicine made me dizzy, but after 2 day, just normal."	7-Jul-14
96165	Sertraline	"The stress from my job causes me to question my decisions and while I am usually right 99% of the time, I still have self-confidence issues that result in panic attacks.  These attacks cloud my thought process and at times have resulted in some pretty stressful presentations.  Therapy, 0.25 mg of Xanax prior to a key presentations (maybe twice a month) and 100 mg of Zoloft daily for the past 6 months have been amazing! I think more clearly, I am much more articulate, don&#039;t worry about my decisions, and sleep at night.  Very few side effects."	13-Feb-12
128149	Phentermine	"I&#039;m 21. My starting weight was 165. For my height, which is 5&#039;1, I&#039;m considered obese. I have been taking phentermine since 04/29/2016, which is 4 days. I have already lost 5 pounds!! I eat small portions, I started drinking nothing but water, and I started walking/running 2-3 times a day. I walk/run first thing in the morning after I eat, again when my daughter takes her 3 hour nap, and once later on in the afternoon when it&#039;s cooler outside and I can take my daughter in her stroller. So far I&#039;m beyond excited because I may (or may not) reach my goal weight in only one month, or maybe two months. My goal weight is 125-130."	2-May-16
71769	Tramadol	"First, tramadol is NOT an opiate, it may work somehow (no one knows how nor can claim to understand how) with receptors for them in the brain but please stop the completely false statements that this is an opiate-simply not true.   Ultram was first used for in the 1990s was pain and then it became clear that if was also helpful for people who were not getting relief from anti-depressants (and did big Pharma push out every variation of SSRI uptake inhibitor at great cost to the public and of course with no clue if they would work).   EXCELLENT alternative to ineffective anti-depressants that big pharma wants to keep pushing.  Again, wrong to even begin to compare it to an opiate, and time for it to be acknowledged as an option for depression."	7-Jan-17
128069	Phentermine	"I am hyper can&#039;t sleep"	23-Jun-16
71723	Tramadol	"I have had severe RLS for 20+ years and it is absolutely a miserable way to live.   Not only is it miserable for the person suffering, it is miserable for any spouse / significant other that you may sleep next to.   11 years ago I was trying to fall asleep, moving and stretching my legs constantly (to no avail, of course) and my husband threw himself in my face screaming &quot;STOP MOVING YOUR LEGS!!!&quot;    That was when I knew I needed to find something that would help -- after trying several different things - all unsuccessful - I tried tramadol.   It has saved my marriage, it has saved my sanity, and because of those 2 things it has most likely saved my life.  For me, tramadol WORKS for RLS."	9-Feb-17
128230	Phentermine	"I was on Phentermine for almost 2 months, I started out weighing 175 pounds and now I am at 155.50. I started out with bad headaches, numbness of feet, cold feet, tingling legs and no appetite.  I am a 38year old female. I was recently seen at the Dr&#039;s office. I went in for my monthly checkup, I was feeling sick my head was hurting bad and I was short of breath. I complained of my feet being numb and my legs feeling tingly. I was immediately taken off the medication. My heart was beating irregular, they said this was a reaction to the medicine and I was feeling sick because my heart was beating irregular. I was admitted from the dr&#039;s office to the emergency room. I will now be seeing a heart specialist to see if there&#039;s any permanent damage"	1-Mar-16
63897	Sertraline	"I took Zoloft (generic) shortly after my anxiety got horribly severe. I took lexapro a few years ago but didn&#039;t like the sexual side effects. Doctor put me on Prozac but that appeared to put me into a deep depression. I had never had depression, just anxiety but I couldn&#039;t get out of bed I was just paralyzed. After a few weeks of that I decided to try Zoloft. Within the first three weeks I felt tremendously better. By 6 weeks I felt totally back to normal and NO sexual side effects! This has been my miracle drug"	16-Aug-17
64338	Sertraline	"Been on Sertiline for 3 years 75mg and find it ok, have suffered from itching some days, and weight gain, better drug than the rest on the UK market."	10-Oct-16
138376	Phentermine	"I just started using Fastin and I like it better than other diet pills I&#039;ve tried such as Hydroxycut because it doesn&#039;t make me feel sick/ nauseous. BUT it definitely makes my heart rate skyrocket, so for the first couple days I would only take half a pill at a time. A full pill makes my hands tremble and I can hear my pulse in my brain."	27-Feb-14
128627	Phentermine	"Started phentermine a week ago.  The first day I literally felt crazy. I was hot, sweaty and extremely active, water was my best friend! Now I just feel energized, not crazy lol. I don&#039;t have an appetite at all and if I go without water I get headaches (shocker).  I take it everyday with the exception of Sunday&#039;s, I know I won&#039;t drink alot of water but I still maintain my eating habits. I&#039;ve been on if for a week now and I started at 189 and today I weighed 181, so 8lbs today. I think it&#039;s great, best decision I&#039;ve made so far, gonna give another update in a month."	18-Jun-15
142000	Escitalopram	"I love Lexapro. I was having chest pain daily along with my heart skipping beats due to stress and anxiety. I began taking Lexapro and hardly ever have chest pain. I feel like myself again. I have gained a good bit of weight, but for me it is worth not having daily chest pains and anxiety."	11-Jun-09
141870	Escitalopram	"I have been on this medicine for several years.  I have anxiety and Lexapro works really good but don&#039;t miss a dose or try to wean yourself off.  It makes you dizzy and you get these Zaps; to my tongue and down my arm.  I am still not off it and went back to my normal dose.  Beware of weight gain, I eat very health and get pretty good physical activity and the weight just keeps creeping up.  Good luck!  "	27-Jul-10
140736	Escitalopram	"i am in  end stage copd  i could not get thought a day untill i started this drug  had a few side effects  but well worth it i fell like me 20 years ago and i don&#039;t sit around feeling sorry for my self any more"	31-Jul-16
64420	Sertraline	"A little over month ago, I was in a dark place. I was having horrific thoughts that were consuming me. Waking up in a panic with a constant nervous feeling. I had zero patience for my kids in fact I did not want to be around them or alone with them. I was constantly upset and teary. I was so against medication and did everything to avoid it. I would visit these forums over and over. I have been on Sertraline for approx a month now. I built up from 12.5mg to 50mg and this drug has saved my life. It really is a miracle. Although I did get side effects to begin with, it was all worth it to feel happy again."	20-Aug-16
141791	Escitalopram	"Lexapro is amazing except for the massive weight gain. I have gained thirty-five pounds in two years. I workout 4 days a week and eat healthy. I have to accept the fact that being mentally healthy comes at having a stomach."	20-Apr-11
141881	Escitalopram	"Been on Lexapro for about 3 weeks after a bad break up. First week was bad, usual side effects. But the past week things have settled down. I feel like I can function at work better. Before that I was totally useless. I still need to address some emotional issues but now I can see some light...Am waiting for the full effects to kick in SOON."	4-Jun-10
71906	Tramadol	"To cut a long story short, NOTHING ELSE HAS EVER WORKED AS QUICK AND AS EFFECTIVE AS THIS MEDICATION FOR ME PERSONALLY FOR SEVERE DEPRESSION AND OR LACK OF BRAIN ENERGY. I&#039;ve tried at least 5 of the mainstream top draw Antidepressants. I hope and pray my GP doesn&#039;t take me off the 100 mgs a day for fear of addiction. When is the medical and pharmaceutical community going to wake up to the amazing healing power of tramadol..."	8-Jan-16
64290	Sertraline	"I took this medication for only 3 days and I experienced extreme tremors, diarrhea, vomiting and even experienced a seizure after the second day. I have been very sick and always tired feeling.   I definitely don&#039;t recommend this also my anxiety got worse not better."	31-Oct-16
141737	Escitalopram	"I have only been on Lexapro for 2 weeks now for my anxiety and depression. I also have a temper problem, the medicine so far helped my anxiety and got me more active but my anger has got worse. Maybe it&#039;s too soon to say if this medicine will help that. But overall I&#039;m starting to like not having the anxious feeling anymore."	16-Dec-11
34196	Tramadol	"I take tramadol for back pain and to help sleep if need be. "	5-Apr-09
138507	Phentermine	"Week 1: Pro&#039;s lost 10 pounds, eat less. Con&#039;s: had headache for 6 days, pills wears out by afternoon, 5pm-6pm. Analysis: user must put effort in portion control or weight will come back after finished with medication. Will follow up in another week. Meal plan: 1500 per day. exercise 5 days week cardio, and strength."	14-Jun-13
95742	Sertraline	"I have been taking Setraline for 6 months  due to Anxiety and mild depression. I am a natural happy and outgoing woman, but due to pressure and high expectations, I guess,  I started feeling anxious and sad all the time. I used to feel chest tightness, rapid palpitations and fear to fail or not do good in life and eventually become a failure. I remember I used to get horrible headaches on a daily basis and even stomach issues. Mind you, I even had a colonoscopy and endoscopy done due to the severity of the digestive problem although the results were okay. Also, I hadinsomia and fatigue. I must confess that all those terrible &quot;symptoms&quot; went away once I started taking this medicine. My mood has improved and I&#039;ve noticed that I am much happier."	12-Nov-14
140899	Escitalopram	"I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 1998 and I have been on a LOT of different medicines. This medicine does NOTHING for my pain but it DOES help my mood a lot. Like many people with FMS I suffer from periodic depression and over the years I have been put on almost every type of antidepressant but all of them left me feeling numb to everything - including if I woke up the next day or not. That feeling always terrified me so I had stopped taking any antidepressants. In October of 2014 my doctor suggested I try this and it has made a HUGE difference in my mood without leaving me numb.  If this helped with my pain I would rate it higher but it is amazing for depression."	17-Jan-16
127533	Phentermine	"Aj - 5&#039;8 - 283LBS After 4 yrs of obesity, 3 of them during my ex&#039;s (children&#039;s father) horrendous battle w/cancer &amp; recent death, here I am.  My family doctor was witness to this emotional journey and my physical decline with weight gain, extreme fatigue and body aches. I had a recent checkup and learned my bloodwork and specialist appt were all clear. I mentioned to Dr. A that I finally feel like I am seeing myself again and wish I could get my body to match my level of happiness and will to do more. He talked to me about Phentermine. After some thought I started on 8/5/17, one 30mg pill daily. Today I am -10lbs! No side effects and sleep well! I &quot;plan&quot; healthy snacks as my appetite is very low. Energy level is up but not crazy."	12-Aug-17
140997	Escitalopram	"I paid $250 for the brand name after having tried the generic 3 months ago with horrible results. Started at 5 mg; immediate increase in anxiety. Bad dreams, insomnia, diarrhea. Doctor said to go up to 10 mg after one week; could not focus, could not eat, intense agitation, uncontrollable crying, crazy thoughts. Anxiety hit the roof- couldn&#039;t leave then house. Saw a pychologist/ next a psychiatrist- immediately stopped the lexapro and within 24 hours felt 90% better.  This drug is not for all. Sexual side effects and weight gain are high for most.  Do your homework."	20-Feb-16
71956	Tramadol	"After two bunion and hammertoe surgeries this worked like a charm! Much better than Percocet because I wasn&#039;t loopy and it does not cause stomach upset!"	19-Jun-15
64618	Sertraline	"This is an excellent antidepressant. It really helps lift you out of the black clouds. It&#039;s also energizing and weight neutral. I highly recommend."	5-Feb-16
72594	Tramadol	"I am on the maximum dosage of 400mg daily off and on for 7 years, and all I know is together with Voltaren, I&#039;m able to live my life again. It also helps significantly with depression associated with pain, and amazingly enough, appetite control. This medicine works absolute wonders for me."	24-Jul-10
128106	Phentermine	"I stated phentermine yesterday 13/6/16 weighed myself this morning I&#039;ve lost 5llb wow. Yesterday I spent 6 hrs decorating my living room was up and down ladder and stretching drank about 4 pints of water had toast and marmalade in the morning . later on had lettuce on bread and a bottle of rose. I&#039;m shocked to see the loss but happy about. Started at 196 want to get to 140."	15-Jun-16
95982	Sertraline	"I had no noticeable negative side effects, and was able to function in a normal way without feeling like it was forced."	15-Apr-13
141995	Escitalopram	"I started Lexapro 10 mg while my mother was terminally ill - very high stress period. It was like a miracle. Totally relaxed me and got me through a rough period. I only experienced two side effects - weight gain (10 lbs) and zero sex drive. Because of the weight gain, I decided to wean myself off a few months after my mother passed away with no problems at all. Then, six months later began suffering the worst anxiety with severe panic attacks. I immediately got back on Lexapro and will try to combat the weight gain with diet and exercise. It was a good drug for me."	19-Jun-09
138638	Phentermine	"I started taking phentermine March 26(Monday), 2012. My first weigh in was 227lbs. I get up at 6:30 am every morning and take it first thing along with chromium picolinate. I do 30mins of body weight training and cardio 4x a week. I only eat 2x a day, usually post workout and grilled chicken, rice and veggies for dinner. I have ice water all the time. I also try to stay moving even after I work out. I did get the dry mouth, but I keep water in hand. I don&#039;t have trouble going to sleep, but have woken up several times a night. Today is Sunday April 1, 2012 and I&#039;m at 217lbs now. That&#039;s 10lbs in 6 days! The pill does work, but not by itself. If you want fast results, you have to work for it. "	1-Apr-12
140806	Escitalopram	"I have been on lexipro going on my third week and have noticed a huge difference. I&#039;m not anxious at all and a lot more e laid back. It has certainly helped to to calm down. Only draw back for me is makes me tired sometimes. I can d al with that ....awesome drug so far"	22-Jun-16
71994	Tramadol	"I have had RLS since I was a child,they didnt know what it was then and called it &quot;growing pains&quot;.I would cry when it rained or was cold, my legs would hurt so bad. Then 15 years ago, as an adult I was given ultram for a neck injury[three ruptured discs] and my RLS just vanished.I couldnt believe it!At first I kept waiting for it to come back, but it didnt. Now I take tramadol 100 mg three times a day,for nerve pain and RLS and it completely controls the symptoms without obnoxious side effects[like nausea vomiting insomnia and sinusitis from requip, loss of cooridination and falling from gabapentin,headaches, blurred vision, nausea and flank pain from lyrica-ugh those drugs were awful!] I sleep well now and feel rested."	26-Oct-15
141501	Escitalopram	"Definitely improving my life. I&#039;m less stressed at work and life with the kids is easier.  Some social settings (crowds) still bothersome, but I&#039;m getting there. One of the pages I read warned about caffeine intake, they weren&#039;t kidding. I cut out caffeine and it lessened my mood swings.  Please read about interactions with other medicines when you start something new, it makes a difference!"	6-Aug-13
128190	Phentermine	"I started taking phentermine 03/29 at 241.6lbs. I was 265lbs in 2010 and lost weight naturally and went to the gym and got down to 211lbs and got lazy and the weight has crept back up. I didn&#039;t think the Rx would work but today 03/30 I was 237.6 after just 1 day. I worked out for 2hrs on my 1st day and had to leave because I was so nauseous. I got a headache and nausea on day 1 and could barely eat. Today was day 2 and my head has been hurting and I&#039;ve been nauseous for over 10hrs and couldn&#039;t go to workout. I am taking 37.5mg I&#039;m the mornings. I read the headache may be hunger or dehydration so I forced down an Apple and naked chicken breast but it was hard to get down and symptoms didn&#039;t go away. I&#039;m gonna try to stick with it."	31-Mar-16
64280	Sertraline	"I&#039;m giving this an 8 because I have only been taking for a few weeks. I am taking 25mg/day along with up to 100mg of Hydroxizine every 6 hours for anxiety. Doc told me it would take about 4-6 weeks for Sertraline to really kick in but, let me tell you, I have already noticed a HUGE difference! Much calmer, clear minded, able to focus, excited to be alive. I just got sober a few weeks ago, so these meds are a Godsend since my body is readjusting to normality. So far, 2 thumbs way up!    Side effects I&#039;ve noticed: HUGE appetite, random small headaches, and lower sex drive. All of these could be from too much caffeine, too little exercise, my body readjusting to sobriety..........or a multitude of other things. Can&#039;t pinpoint them to the meds."	7-Nov-16
128606	Phentermine	"I started this pill on 4/13/15.  At that time I weighed 168, my height is 5&#039;1&quot;.  As of 5/21/15 I have lost 11 pounds.  This pill definitely helps to curb your appetite and give you an energy boost.  I think it&#039;s super important to setup good eating habits and a solid exercise routine while you have the extra energy, especially since this isn&#039;t a pill you&#039;ll be able to take long term.  Use it to your advantage!!  Good luck all, sounds like everyone is doing really well.  Yay us!!!!"	21-May-15
127952	Phentermine	"I started these pills on 09/26/16 my starting weight was 226 pounds so its been I guess almost 2 weeks stepped on the scale 10/05/16 and I am down to about 210 pounds which is good because I did not feel like I lost anything....When I first started I was very jittery, headache, and not eating a lot of stuff my goal is to get up under 200 pounds and come off of the pill within the next month I am hoping. I have started to experience a little of chest pain I am 27 years old and 5&#039;5 so at my age i really want to lose inches so I am going to start adding exercise in my diet maybe a routine. I hope this helps."	6-Oct-16
214669	Escitalopram	"If I were to just review this drug from an anxiety/fear of social interaction standpoint, I would say that Lexapro is awesome. Lexapro has stopped me from having tremors every time someone talked to me out of the blue, and I do not mind being in the spotlight anymore during classes. For (group) presentations, I still feel physical symptoms and my tremor building up, but not nearly as much as I did without Lexapro. My biggest fear happens to be giving presentations and this is what I am taking it for primarily. I think if I were to do a standalone presentation, I would still have A LOT of difficulty focusing on the topic at hand but not because of anxiety. This drug makes it very hard for me to focus in school. Hope to go down to 5mg from 10"	24-Aug-17
97043	Ambien	"This medicine works to get me to sleep and stay asleep. HOWEVER I quickly become dependent on it and cant get to sleep without it so I can&#039;t take it as needed. Also I noticed that I seem to need larger doses rapidly. My insomnia issues are generally manageable if I avoid caffeine and don&#039;t eat too close to bedtime."	17-Nov-13
139169	Phentermine	"Phentermine 37.5, helped me in a very positive way. As a person who has high blood pressure and diabetes it was a must to lose weight. I was exercising everyday but still gaining weight because of diabetes medicines. Well in the first month I have gone from 234lbs to 218lbs and on my way to 190lbs. I recommend finding what works for you. For me, I started taking it 6am and would have a snack bar around 12 noon. Then another snack bar around 2:30pm and then a regular healthy meal with more vegetables maybe 5 pm. I might have a snack bar around 7pm and that is it. Also I drink plenty of water all day. I exercise 4 times a week as well as cardio and aerobics. I find the longer I wait after taking medicine before eating the better the results."	28-Mar-09
96937	Ambien	"People, be careful with Ambien. I was put on Ambien 10 mg back in late 2014, I recently stopped the medication told turkey. It&#039;s been a week since I quit, I have been having severe withdrawal. Nightmares, night sweats, and frequent urination are the most occurring symptoms I have been dealing with. Doctors seldom tell patients about drug withdrawals, which is why I am suffering from these problems. So, be careful before you take a new prescribed medication."	18-Jul-16
128735	Phentermine	"Sorry . . Continued. . Started taking phentermine 37.5 and b12 shot once a week on 02/20/15. Started @ 225lbs and size 18. By 03/20/15 I am down to a 16 and weight is 213! My weight is coming off a little slower than most Lol but I&#039;ve always had to work harder for my results, the reason I started this medication. But I am very pleased because I workout and eat healthy anyway so this is only an aid for me. W/o this med I would not have lost this much so soon. On my own with a strict diet and working out everyday I only lost 8 lbs in 6 weeks. Only side effect is I&#039;m getting bumps on my face, shoulders, back, and chest. Sometimes can&#039;t sleep @ night, and occasionally dry mouth. I can deal with those! Feeling great! Will update in 30 days!!!!!!"	28-Mar-15

138885	Phentermine	"I have been on Adipex since the beginning of December and my starting weight was 271 and as of Thursday I weighed in at 246. I am very pleased with my weight loss and very disappointed in myself to have reached a whopping 270. I guess it&#039;s better late than never. I do experience some side effects which includes dry mouth and constipated at times. When this happens I drink even more water and drink a swig of vinegar..it usually helps. I have not incorporated exercise in my plan yet but plan to start next week.   I wanted to get the diet down pact first..I do recommend this pill for anyone that has a lot of weight to lose!"	24-Jan-10
64993	Sertraline	"Been on it for 3 months.  At first it was worse. The panick attacks and anxiety. Then it was like my brain flipped the switch. I feel so much better. Im 30 and started getting anxiety at 22. I never wanted meds.  Fought hard and tried everything natural.  Finally I gave in.  I&#039;m so happy now. I am not afraid of my own shadow anymore.  I think I may have put on 3lbs from it, but as long as it stops there.  Or it could be all the cookies. Give it a try.  I&#039;m not cured, but I NEVER want to go off Zoloft."	23-Dec-14
138788	Phentermine	"I just started Adipex-P 37.5mg on March 6th, 2011. I am in the military and am a single mom of two. I work and go to school full time so its hard for me to work out everyday even though I&#039;m supposed to. I have never really had trouble losing weight until I started working night shift in May. I would only eat one meal a day but since it was late I gained the weight. I am 5&#039;5 and weighed 184lbs before I was put on this pill. The first day I took it was right after the doctors appointment. By 5pm and I had only eaten one piece of ham. I bought a salad after I took the pill and tried to eat it when I got home at 6 and couldn&#039;t because I had no urge to want to eat. It&#039;s Wednesday now and I&#039;ve lost 4lbs already."	10-Mar-11
64433	Sertraline	"hello, i was seriously in trouble with my ocd, tried several meds including cipralex and seroquel but cipralex was not as effective so i changed to lustral, i am now cured and i cant believe it, it is like a second life present from god! if you have ocd problems it is the best, but i guess everyone s system is different so everyone should find what med suits them."	19-Jun-16
140811	Escitalopram	"Been on this med 9 weeks still feel no better had awful side effects  still getting them worse  one burning tingling arms not sleeping don&#039;t know what to do anyone else had this"	18-Jun-16
141070	Escitalopram	"At 37 I was woken in the night by my first panic attack, I dialed 911. For 4 months I&#039;ve been crippled with 24-7 severe anxiety accompanied with 2-4 panic attacks a day. Looking back I&#039;ve had GAD my whole life but a stressful event finally brought it to the surface. After 3 months I sought a psychiatrist and today is day 14 on generic Lexapro (Escitalopram.) I began on 5mg and yesterday was increased to 7.5. Within 9 days I noted improvment but I had bad side effects. I made myself hang on and today I can tell you IT WORKS! I have a ways to go and will update as I progress but this medicine meant life or death to me and has in 14 days allowed me to care for myself and my kids again. Push through the side effects and give it time! It works!"	8-Nov-15
96414	Sertraline	"Took this for 10 months. Finally switched to another medication since I didn&#039;t notice any benefits."	8-Jan-11
140582	Escitalopram	"Have been on and off lexapro for the last 20 years (more on than off). This time I was off the medication from for about 5 months and the anxiety and depression was back even though I had a change of life style, doing plenty of exercise and changing work environments.  For me the side effects were feeling nauseous, insomnia (normally 1 nights average sleep and the next no sleep, constant swallowing which I think is called dry mouth and just feeling miserable for the first 3 weeks.  I&#039;m into my fourth week now and sleeping a lot better and feeling much better in myself.   If you are having the same side effects, hang in there as life will get a lot better"	27-Nov-16
71948	Tramadol	"I just started this med yesterday for osteoarthritis &amp; fibromyalgia. After reading the other comments my experience is pretty normal. I&#039;m itching like crazy, had a bad night-no rest, nausea &amp; mild headache. With all those side effects, it appears to have knocked off the edge of the pain. I will continue using if for a few days if I can handle the itching. I want to give it some time because I cannot use narcotics. I end up in the hospital with dehydration from vomiting when I use any narcotics."	9-Jul-15
138485	Phentermine	"This is my second post...I started on 3/6/14 and today 4/16/14, I have lost 22 pounds. It could have been more if I just got myself back in the gym. My daily meals consists of breakfast - one egg w/cheese and one turkey link, no lunch around 2pm I have yogurt and BelVita crackers &amp; dinner - whatever I want but no bread and I don&#039;t eat after 7:30pm. Also, I do not take the pill over the weekend! Good Luck everyone!"	16-Apr-14
95870	Sertraline	"I have now been on Zoloft for 2 months and happy to report, I&#039;m no longer NEEDING my oxazepam everyday YAY!  Side effects I got were crazy heart palpitations, fatigue but both of these have subdued, mind you, it took 7 wks to do so, so for anyone just starting on it, stick it out. Its helped a lot with my anxiety."	17-Jun-14
72543	Tramadol	"I found this drug pretty good for pain, but that came with some anxiety which I had to take Valium to help with that."	14-Nov-09
72144	Tramadol	"I have been depression for over 7 years but in that short period of time I was immediately suicidal. By &quot;fate&quot; I found my salvation. One day I was saying my goodbye to all as I could not live any longer with such sadness and complete doom. I was sitting with my mom and during all the crying I told her I had a severe headache. She only had tramadol. I took two. It saved my life that day and is still. I had tried before and even after all kinds of other medicines and none worked."	28-Feb-15
72126	Tramadol	"I really had  been suffering this complex and less studied disorder which can seriously affect your efficacy. Fortunately I shifted to a country were no good COX-2 inhibitors were available for my on and off back pain so I was given tramadol 50mg twice daily. Once I took a cap after 2 hours I find my legs quite fine and sensation free, which I used to have for a decade on and off  "	22-Nov-13
34186	Tramadol	"I have multiple hernias in my low back and neck. My doctor abruptly stopped my Vicodin because I had used it long term and was losing the effect of pain relief. Started Ultram 400mg a day. No withdrawal symptoms from Vicodin. My pain level though didn&#039;t improve from the Vicodin. I still feel the same as I did as the last few months of Vicodin use. I have had bad withdrawal symptoms in the past from fentanyl and am a little worried about having to come off Ultram someday as it appears to be hard to come off of. So basically it works like weak Vicodin for me and I have had some erectile dysfunction symptoms as well. I saw someone else comment on that. I&#039;m young and never had any type of problems. I also take Lyrica 150mg three times a day."	21-Apr-09
128722	Phentermine	"I heard my friends talking about this so I thought I&#039;d give it a try, I&#039;ve been taking it for 8 weeks and lost 18 pounds. I have been working out like crazy too. THIS WILL NOT MAKE YOU LOSE WEIGHT, it&#039;s an appitite suppressent. You still have to eat right and excersise!!!"	3-Apr-15
95791	Sertraline	"I have been unemployed now for three years and things have gone from bad to worse. I found myself losing control of my temper and crying for no reason or if someone said something that negative. I couldn&#039;t sleep and when I did it was for two hours at a time. Sometimes I would stay up just crying. To add to my problems my back pain were getting worse. Doctor diagnose me with depression and gave me Zoloft. I started at 25mg for four days and then up to 50mg. It has been only a week, but I am not crying unexpectedly and feel calmer than I have in quite a while and have actually slept 5 hours straight. I had no side effects."	1-Mar-14
142006	Escitalopram	"I have been diagnosed with ADHD (due to chronic, extreme lack of concentration), depression and anxiety. About 2 years ago, I began taking, by prescription, Effexor XR 75mg/day. My doctor at the time did not know much about SSRI&#039;s. The Effexer was working great but, she decided to send me to a counselor who cannot write prescriptions. My &quot;doctor&quot; stopped my Effexor, cold turkey, for no apparent reason, knowing counselor&#039;s cannot give it to me. I immediately began having extreme withdrawal symptoms. My every move caused me to hear and feel electrostatic &quot;ticks&quot;. My head, ears, and jaw felt it was going to explode from pressure, and I was weak and uncoordinated. I honestly thought I was dying for over 2 weeks. I&#039;m now taking Lexapro, Adderal, and Valium."	9-May-09
128385	Phentermine	"I started the pill on 10/9/15 I was 172.2 at the doctors, I&#039;m a 24 year old female, 4&quot;11 tall, weighed myself today 10/29/15 and I&#039;m 11 pounds lighter! I&#039;m 161.3!  No cravings for sweets which I have/had a HORRIBLE sweet tooth, stopped eating fast food as much, cut it out more than half, can&#039;t wait to see more progress. I work 6 days a week as a stylist and have a 5 year old in school full time, working out is hard but I try to fit 30 min in either in the morning or at night, I use myfitnesspal to track my calorie intake, 1200 a day mostly less, dry mouth but as long as I drink my water all day I&#039;m good. Will update next month!"	29-Oct-15

119757	Ambien CR	"After having an accident at work a few years ago I wasn&#039;t falling asleep until the sun came up because of chronic pain.  My muscle relaxers and pain medicines were no longer giving me enough relief to sleep at night so my doctor put me on Ambien CR.  After about 2 weeks I had to stop taking it because I was hallucinating, I was suffering from severe anxiety, I had tremors, I don&#039;t have enough room here to list everything.  I am now on Restoril and I don&#039;t have any side effects at all."	8-Apr-10
71797	Tramadol	"I have been the guinea pig, like most of us who suffer from anxiey, depression, ocd tendencies, etc.  I have tried more &quot;psych&quot; meds then I care to count.  Some did nothing.  Some made me physically sick.  One made me homicidal.  I have never been a fan of narcotics.  They too do not agree with me.  After herniated disc/back surgery 3 years ago, Dr said I needed to take at least something.  So I got Tramadol.  200mg a day. If I had pain, I was too calm and happy to notice.  Life was great!  I had energy and focus.  I was on this regimen for about 20 days.  About the third day into not taking Tramadol, I felt like hell!  Talked with PCP who pulled me off lexapro and now I take this.  Do have .5mg xanax for bad panic attacks.  I feel amazing!"	13-Sep-16
140559	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve struggled with anxiety for years and worried about everything!  I finally tried escitalopram!  One of the best things I ever did!  I was so scared of living in a fog from past experiences with anxiety meds.!   In the first week I found 10mg to be to much, so I started cutting down to 2 mg!  When I was ready or felt anxiety sneaking on me again I would up it another 2 mg!  Yes all the side affects are real and possible!  But after 4 to 5 weeks I was able to level out!  I gave it my best shot and it was worth it in the end!  I&#039;m now taking 10mg daily!  hope this was helpful"	2-Mar-17
71975	Tramadol	"My doctor put me on this for a nerve condition which typically leaves me in dull pain, with occasional fierce spikes in pain. He noted that it is a &quot;very powerful painkiller&quot; so be careful. I took one, waited an hour or so, nothing. Took the second one, and again now almost 3 hours later I feel 100% the same, the pain has not been reduced at all. I took 1 200mg advil, and felt a minor amount of relief, so this is about the power of maybe a baby aspirin. Hardly a &quot;powerful painkiller. I thought maybe it was just me, but after some research I see I am not alone. I think this medicine is nothing short of pharmaceutical grade snake oil. I will be going back to my doctor to rid this hoax in a bottle."	18-Aug-15
140511	Escitalopram	"The reason for my review is in hope that I can convince someone out there who needs help with their anxiety to try this medication. It seriously has been changing my life. It&#039;s only been 2 months and I&#039;m already feeling &quot;normal&quot;. It took a little less than a month for me to really start feeling happier and less anxious. I used to be very negative because of my anxiety. I never wanted to socialize or do anything. I started a new job, which used to be one of my biggest anxiety triggers. But it has been going so well! I&#039;m social and can talk to my coworkers and customers with confidence and my negative thoughts aren&#039;t really there anymore. I&#039;ll admit the side effects the first few weeks were horrible! Just stick it out, I promise it&#039;s worth it."	31-Oct-16
64498	Sertraline	"It&#039;s hard for me to remember who I was before I started this medication, to be quite honest I don&#039;t want to either. I was angry, always ended up in arguments or fights with family, I had major depressive episodes to the point I wondered if I had bipolar(I do not, otherwise this medication wouldn&#039;t have worked afaik). I had constant anxiety to the point where I once had to lay in my bed for an entire week because the only time I wasn&#039;t in constant fear was when I was sleeping. I started this and everything changed, I&#039;m not really happy but I am not depressed which is a blessing for someone like me who wanted to die every minute. I don&#039;t argue or fight with people much anymore unless it&#039;s unavoidable. I also lost my mild OCD."	7-Jun-16
64348	Sertraline	"Have previously used progesterone tablets which worked fairly well however I had a break and then my gp told me to use these instead. Horrid 3 days! I could deal with the nausea and low mood as I was prepared for it, but I lost my orgasm on just 25mg and 3 tablets. Not for me!"	16-Aug-16
97193	Ambien	"Ambien does not do a thing for me. I started taking 10mg before bed and worked up to taking it 5 or 6 hours before bed without any change. I even tried taking 10mg in the afternoon and 10mg in the evening and still no help with sleep."	21-Oct-10
141949	Escitalopram	"Lexapro quickly lifted me out of depression and kept me that way. I was really impressed at how un-depressed I felt, and with no apparent side effects. As advertised, it worked fabulously as an antidepressent. It lifted me out of the darkness and into the, well, the GRAY. Don&#039;t get me wrong--it was great to be out of depression--just not at the expense of the glint in my eyes. My psychiatrist asked me about my relationships, and it hit me that I didn&#039;t really have any. I couldn&#039;t remember the last time I felt aroused, let alone had an orgasm. He cut my dose in half, but it didn&#039;t help. Depression decended rapidly, so he put me back on Prozac. It will work well for awhile, but for now I am back to life, love, and some mighty fine sex."	27-Oct-09
119806	Ambien CR	"My husband was taking this and was eating late at night, getting on the computer, and doing other things and having no memory of it the day after. He felt drugged when he took it. I don&#039;t recommend it to anyone."	27-Feb-08
72484	Tramadol	"This medicine makes me feel weak and I have a slight chest tightness after taking 4 tablets over a 2 day period. Every 12 hours I will report to doctor and not take this ever again although it was 75% effective. Chest tightness is listed under severe reactions."	16-Sep-11
142084	Escitalopram	"I am an 18 year old female, 5&#039;4&quot;, 118 lbs, currently on 40 mg of Lexapro and 80 mg of Vyvanse for anxiety and other issues. Mild nausea for the first couple days of treatment, fine after that. No other notable effects until going from 30 to 40, now noticed a somewhat decreased sex drive and some difficulty orgasming. Still deciding whether that&#039;s worth it.    Otherwise, Lexapro is decent. No fabulous turnaround for me, but definitely helping me get on with life :-)"	22-Mar-08
72050	Tramadol	"I found by accident that tramadol greatly diminishes my depression. If I knew I could take it daily without building a tolerance against it I would gladly take it for the rest of my life. As it is, I limit taking it to no more than once a week out of that fear. For just ONE DAY of my life without depression it is worth it."	15-May-15
128402	Phentermine	"I&#039;m taking this medicicattion because of an odd amount of weight gain relating to hypothyroidism and that in relation to my first and only pregnancy.   Ive went from 135lbs to 169lbs in less than a year. I stressed this problem and was recommended Phentermine.   I&#039;ve lost about 10lbs since taking it a month ago. I eat half of my portion sizes. I consume lighter, healthier foods. More energy.   Downsides to this new medication though are bad dry mouth in the afternoon. My heart feels like its going to burst out of my chest depending on emotions. And sleeping! I&#039;m usually up till 12, 2, 3 o&#039;clock in the morning sometimes. Everyday I&#039;m awake inside but outside I don&#039;t look so good.   Going to continue another two months and see what happens."	15-Sep-15
64930	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been battling ptsd since a kid. I tried celexa for two months and it didn&#039;t do anything so I quit taking it, 6 years later I went to a different Dr who prescribed me Zoloft. Started with 50mg for two months and bumped up to 100mg. It does take a few to get use to but the side effects go away with a week or two. This drug it&#039;s not drowsy, and actually works. I&#039;m talking more, coming out of my shell. Laughing. Doing stuff again. All I can say give it a chance I say two months, off not working talk to Dr and try something else..I have tried something else...and this is working great so far. The heavy weight that held mange captive in my depression was lifted within the first two weeks. Two thumbs up so far. And affordable, I get generic"	19-Mar-15
64270	Sertraline	"I don&#039;t know how anyone can tolerate this drug. It made my anxiety ten times worse, gave me bad thoughts, and made me feel like a zombie for 2 weeks. I think experiencing this medication and then getting off it helped my anxiety much more than the medicine itself did."	13-Dec-16
96214	Sertraline	"It really works for me."	27-Jun-11
214630	Escitalopram	"I haven&#039;t looked back since I&#039;ve been taking 5mg of escitolopram at night my mind is so much more calm."	9-Aug-17
96614	Sertraline	"Of the 4 medications I&#039;ve been on for social anxiety Zoloft helped me the most.  "	6-Aug-08
96805	Ambien	"It helped me sleep, but only 4 hrs  with 10 mg dosage"	25-Jan-17
95880	Sertraline	"This is not a complete review because I&#039;ve only been taking Sertraline for a short time, but it may help new users on side effects. I started noticing right away I was happier, but I also had a lot of the uncommon side effects like drug-induced panic attacks and jitters among others. The doctor told me to continue so I hope those feelings subside because that&#039;s the reason I began this medication in the first place - not to have them! Crossing fingers."	25-May-14
97190	Ambien	"I took Ambien for years and it helped me sleep, at first. Then, instead of sleeping I would walk around without any memory of it. I gained weight from eating without any memory. I think Ambien could be great for occasional insomnia but I don&#039;t recommend it for long term use."	29-Oct-10
142010	Escitalopram	"Lexapro has been a God send for me. I started off with 10 mg and it didn&#039;t do a thing, so I was increased to 20 mg, and wow what a difference. I now find myself actually starting conversations with people - something the pre-Lexapro me could have never dreamed. I feel so much more relaxed - like a real person, finally. No side effects at all either except it definitely increases the effects of alcohol. Didn&#039;t really do much for my depression, but I think just feeling less anxious is helping it along."	1-May-09
52706	Allegra-D 24 Hour	"Yes, this medication works to eliminate symptoms of allergies, however I had a big issue with - what I&#039;m assuming is - a side effect of the medication. When I took the medication my personality immediately changed; I actually became less talkative and happy and it severely affected my life to the point where I randomly started crying during school. I&#039;m assuming that the medication put me in a depression-esque state (I&#039;ve never had depression before so I can&#039;t say for sure) but it altered my personality in ways my personality has never changed for the three days I took it and people noticed. It was honestly terrifying. Be wary of the side effects when taking this medication."	18-Aug-16
64255	Sertraline	"I was suffering with anxiety with constant running thoughts and feeling overwhelmed. I did 1 on 1 counselling sessions then took the next step by trying medication. I&#039;ve never been prescribed medication nor take any thing even if I have a headache. I was started on 25mg once a day and now have been on it for about 4 weeks. I must say this has been the one of the best choices I have ever made. I immediately felt relieved from anxious thoughts and stress . I am more calm and can think clearly without worrying. At first yes I experienced very moderate side effects like the blurred vision, light, fogginess but it takes time for your brain neurons to adjust. I would say after 4 days of taking it I felt fine. I finally have my life back !!!"	24-Dec-16
128004	Phentermine	"I&#039;m a 40yr old mother of 1, struggling with weight loss. In the beginning of the year, I entered a biggest loser challenge. From January to March I lost a total of 14lbs by diet and exercise. I started off and 214lbs and by march I was 200lbs. I did lots of cardio using a beachbody at home workout called &quot;Cize&quot; with Shaun T. Well I plateaud and got discouraged. I also started to go back to me old eating habits. Guess what I gained it all back by August. Weighing 213lbs  On August 29 I started phentermine 37.5. I take my pill at 5am and I&#039;m currently down 5lbs in one week. I also  do at least 45 min cardio, drinks lots of water and watch my calorie in take. The side affects have also subsided. I can sleep now"	4-Sep-16
63940	Sertraline	"I have not found that I have any side effects from this but I notice a huge difference in my mental health. Actually, my boyfriend wasn&#039;t really a believer in antidepressants but when he saw the change in me when I started taking these, he completely switched sides. Some people really do need them. I&#039;m so glad I got on this, I feel so much better."	28-May-17
64363	Sertraline	"I&#039;m a woman in my late 60&#039;s who has taken Sertraline for several years. I started just crying in the beginning stages of menopause. My doctor started me on this med &amp; it helped greatly. After a couple years  tried going off with the assistance of my doctor however started crying again. So I went back on. Worked in a stressful environment so the med worked well. After retiring I tried again to go off the med. Thinking no more stress in my life it would be easier to do without any drug. NOT...I still started crying. So I&#039;ve decided I will stay on this drug as long as I can. I have had success with it. The only thing I struggle with is sweating.  My dosage is 50 mg daily."	30-Jul-16
139041	Phentermine	"Worked great! Never gained weight back!"	28-Apr-09
95897	Sertraline	"I&#039;m 20, and on my fifth day on sertraline, and I&#039;m already feeling great! I have generalized anxiety and social anxiety, which had caused me to feel extremely nervous even around close friends and family. I hardly spoke in groups, and people thought that I was just being quiet because I was a quiet person, when really, I was just afraid that my voice would shake and make me look stupid. My first two days on sertraline were a bit tough. I had a presentation which caused me a lot of anxiety, even more than usual (maybe because of the new chemicals in my body). But somehow, my presentation was very successful, and after it was over, I felt so accomplished. Since then I am noticing some fantastic changes. I&#039;m becoming optimistic about my life."	26-Oct-13
128405	Phentermine	"I started taking Phentamine on 9/9/2015 weighing at 190lbs at my heaviest.  Today 9/14/2015 I weigh 185lbs.  I noticed that I have less appetite especially in the morning. I do not have troubles sleeping at all, perhaps do to my jogging routine of two miles before bedtime."	14-Sep-15
139115	Phentermine	"I am 41 years old and have been taking phentermine as of September 2, 2008 to December 20, 2008. I have lost 35 pounds. It has been a huge blessing in my life. I went from a size 20 pants and 2x or 3x tops to a size 10 pants and from large to medium tops. It is awesome. It has been a great experience but be sure to see a doctor before taking this medication. The side effects I experienced were dry mouth (I chewed sugar-free gum all of the time and drank lots of water) and constipation. It seems to get better after being on the pill for awhile. Energy (treadmill 5 to 6 times a week and get this - I love it). I&#039;m taking a three week break right now. I&#039;ll let you know how it goes. Good luck."	7-Jan-09
141769	Escitalopram	"This is my 4th day on Lexapro and I already feel ten times better then I did this past weekend. I suffer from anger, depression and anxiety and due to this it cost me a 9 year relationship with my partner. I could not bare the fact we broke up because of my personal issues which put me more deeper in depression/anxiety. I could not eat, sleep or go to work without crying or feel like I just wanted to disappear. I don&#039;t know what I would do if I was not on Lexapro. I&#039;m finally starting to feel like myself again and see positive aspects of life instead of all the negatives. I love Lexapro and hope after 2 weeks when it&#039;s completely in my system things only get better. I would recommend Lexapro to anyone suffering from these conditions."	14-Jul-11
97170	Ambien	"Works so well, but have been taking it for years. Wish wish wish I could sleep without it.  Don&#039;t like pills but unable to sleep without it.  If you can&#039;t sleep, nothing works like this. I&#039;ve tried everything; herbs, melatonin, Tryptophane, over the counter sleep aids, etc. Nothing else works. Truly an amazing creation. "	26-Jun-12
140919	Escitalopram	"Like many others have written, this drug has dramatically improved my quality of life. I have been taking it for about 1 year and have been too busy feeling good to write a review. Before: I was plagued with extreme panic, afraid to be alone, afraid to take a shower, constantly worrying, &quot;what if&quot; scenarios, thought I would have to quit my job, lost weight because of NO appetite. Now: all I can say is pretty much living like a normal person! I do feel anxious at times, but I didn&#039;t want to turn into a robot w no feelings! I am thriving at work, socially have made new friends, can concentrate so well (this might be my favorite part), no sexual side effects whatsoever, weight maintained at a healthy level. 5mg   I am so thankful for this drug"	27-Dec-15
128706	Phentermine	"My initial Dr appt was on February 23, 2015. I was at exactly 250 lbs., 5&#039;2&quot;, 28 years old and have a 6 year old son. In the month of March, I lost an amazing 12 lbs., in the first 3 weeks!!! I didn&#039;t have the finances the following month and a half, but I went back yesterday (4-24-15). All in all, it works. My first month I was prescribed one 37.5MG tablet a day. With this being my &quot;2nd&quot; month with no significant weight loss (bc of my 7 weeks of no meds), I am now prescribed 1&amp;1/2, 37.5MG tablets a day. One tablet when I wake up, half of a tablet 5 hrs after that. Will check back with results!! My side effects-dry mouth, some sleeplessness, occasional agitation (very seldom), amazing weight loss!!!!!"	25-Apr-15
128354	Phentermine	"I started taking them in May 2015, I weighed 196, first week I lost five lbs, I did get dry mouth dizziness, constipation, and insomnia, had to force my self to sleep, and doing Zumba with this pill and a Herbalife pill with or without it together I felt like my heart was jumping out of my chest when exercising it did give me a boost of energy but I started freaking out about it, also my bones like the joints started hurting.. Think they warn u to take calcium or iron pills, vitamins. Month later I&#039;m at 182.  After that I would take half here and there then stopped  till October. Now I weigh 176 I&#039;ve started researching cause of chest pains, tired, headache, all the negatives I&#039;ve read when they were tested, not worth the health risk"	19-Nov-15
138642	Phentermine	"I started taking Phentermine in January of this year. I took about a months worth, (I did not take it on weekends) &amp; by February I had lost 20 pounds. I stopped taking Phentermine for a month or so, (didnt gain any old weight back), then I got back on it this past Monday (3/19) &amp; today I weighed myself &amp; I lost 5 pounds in those few days. Right now, the pill is working great, but there are some negatives. Phentermine gives you dry mouth (BAD), which makes me thirsty, which causes me to constantly be peeing. It&#039;ll give you insomnia, nausea, &amp; unpleasant taste to some of your foods or drinks. I would recommend NOT drinking soda or eating fast food."	22-Mar-12
141305	Escitalopram	"The first week and a half I started 5mg of Lexapro was a nightmare.  I would have a psychedelic experience each night when I would try to sleep.  It was like my mind was wondering through the expanse of the universe.  Very trippy.  However, after that first week or so, that feeling went away and it has been nothing less than a miracle for anxiety.  Ever since my best friend was killed in a head on collision with a drunk driver 4 years ago, I had been extremely worried and anxious that the same scenario would play out with another loved one.  I would obsess over this daily and was driving myself crazy.  Now that I&#039;m on Lexapro, I don&#039;t have those feelings anymore.  Sure, I worry about things sometimes, but now I&#039;m free from obsessing."	3-Dec-14
140859	Escitalopram	"Hello, I have been taking escitalopram 10 mg for the past 2 years. My story: I never considered myself as someone with GAD but all the sudden I broke down and had panic attacks and lost 20 pounds in 10 days because I couldn&#039;t eat anything. I was only living on water and maybe a yogurt per day. I always had the feeling of choking and that something is in my throat. I was in therapy for 2 years by then, but for other reasons: I felt lonely. I was far away from my family, 29 years old and felt being late with everything. Finishing school, not being married, no real friends... I think the circumstances were triggering. After 2 years of taking it I feel very good. Intense long dreams dry mouth are my side effects."	8-Apr-16
96274	Sertraline	"I was switched from Lexapro to Zoloft 50mg about a week ago and I found it quite helpful for calming my mind from obsessive thoughts and depressed feeling. Now I am on 75 mg and it is further improving my condition. After 1 week, I will be on 100 mg and I am hoping that it will give me more good results."	18-Mar-11
64434	Sertraline	"I found out I have PTSD, Social Anxiety Disorder and general Anxiety Disorder. I was putting myself in a bubble and would curl up in a ball just to escape. I quit a job I loved because of the stress, I quit going to to the grocery store and other public places because the anxiety was too much. Ithe was effecting my relationships and I was in a bad place where I thought that was what life was about.   After being diagnosed, I was given Zoloft. I looked at my phsycharist like he was crazy. Like this one pill a day would really have the effect of fixing me. I have taken it religiously, every day as prescribed. After 4 weeks I want to cry. I was missing so much, and haven&#039;t felt this good on years. I have my life back. Thank you zoloft"	19-Jun-16
127758	Phentermine	"I started taking the apidex in January.  I was prescribe 1 per day. My original weight was 305. I went for my follow  up on 1/27/17. From 1/21/17 untill 1/27/17 I had lost 2.5 lbs in 6 days. My next visit is on 2/28/17 I will let you know if I lost any more weight. I have not done any exercise but I do have a lot more energy. I can walk without giving out of breath. So I hope I have lost more."	14-Feb-17
128249	Phentermine	"Starting taking this 4 years ago. Lost 20 lbs.  It works but if u take it too long you have terrible side effects. Severe dry mouth, bad breath, wired, can&#039;t focus, constipation. I mentioned to the Dr the side effects and he said he&#039;s never had anyone complain about any negative side effects. I also asked if I should only take the medication for a certain period of time and he said no. I guess he got his money so he didn&#039;t care.  I just went off it and have gained about 8lbs back but that&#039;s because you fall hard. You are tired all the time. Like I said it works but I think I will try the eating healthy and exercise."	11-Feb-16

64032	Sertraline	"Was on lexapro 20mg one a day for year thought I would try something different  Dr said try Zoloft 50 mg a day OMG what a mistake. First week bad dreams, rash, itchy, dizziness no sex drive etc. terrible not for me going back on lexapro."	19-Feb-17

140569	Escitalopram	"My brother told me about how it helped him and it sounded just the ticket. Been on it for about 6 months and I no longer get furious in a nano second. Much better for me and the kids"	2-Dec-16
139155	Phentermine	"I started taking the pill right after Thanksgiving 08. I started at 215lbs now I&#039;m 185lbs. It has worked really well for me."	11-Apr-09
214691	Escitalopram	"This medicine is amazing. I was on 20 mg and now I&#039;m on 10. My symptoms were tremendous that you can&#039;t imagine. When I started taking this medicine  I had a racing heart but the doctor tells me that is a sign that the medicine is working. The side effects went away in the first month and I got better with some aerobic exercices..5-10 mins a day. Its been 2 years on this medicine. This work fine. Don&#039;t be scared just patient and if you have panic attack , try to distract your self.. Good luck to all , and never give up guys !"	29-Sep-17
128570	Phentermine	"I took phentermine in 2002 on and off and lost a lot of weight. I started again on Tuesday 24 June. I currently weigh 195lbs and am 5ft 7. I wanted to ask people this forum who have had a good weightloss if they took the tablet or capsule and also if they have changed their eating habits and if they count calories? When I took it years ago I don&#039;t recall eating a lot, but now I was told I need to eat 1200 calories in order for it to work successfully. Is this correct? Thanks in advance for reading and responding."	25-Jun-15
127917	Phentermine	"I started taking this medicine last week so I could lose weight faster and for the first few days the pills were working. They were making me not eat as much and I had a lot of energy. About 3 or 4 days later things got worse, I started getting very angry and agitated at everyone. I ignored this and thought it would go away, but it didn&#039;t. I started getting really depressed thoughts and it felt like I had to take this pill or my mood would get worse. The mood swings were getting worse so I put an end to this medicine. Wouldn&#039;t recommend this if you already have depression because it can make it worse on you"	26-Oct-16
141227	Escitalopram	"Lexapro saved my life and saved my mind.  I have pure OCD and anxiety.  I tried other anxiety medications before and was ready to give up.  My primary doctor recommended I try Lexapro. I started off at 10mg and started to feel better after a month or two but was still having compulsions from my OCD (although much fewer) so I asked my Doctor to up my medication.  She put me on 20mg and I have been on 20mg for more than six months now.  My life has changed.  I have never felt so alive and so real.  I have never felt so sane.  I can function for the first time in ten years at the degree someone &quot;normal&quot; functions act."	29-May-15

34232	Tramadol	"ZALDIAR- 37.5 mg tramadol/ 325mg paracetamol -tablets were prescribed to me every 4-6 hours for chronic pain following a severe leg infection and ulceration that wouldn&#039;t heal. I tried other over the counter pills including paracetamol, but couldn&#039;t sleep at night or concentrate on anything with the pain. ZALDIAR has been great - provided you don&#039;t forget to take it. If you do the pain comes back very quickly. Side effects so far - very dry, horrible tasting mouth, loss of appetite (a good thing) and feel a little confused at times and forgetful (maybe that&#039;s just age) and a little nausea. Feel so much better now pain is under control - thanks to those who invented tramadol."	17-Jan-09
97290	Ambien	"When it works, it works well with no next day grogginess.  I am a long time user, beginning in 2001.  I have pretty much stopped, after using it every night for 9 years.  I have tried Lunesta and I sleep two hours even with double dose.  Rozerem had no effect.  I may be trying Seroquel next.  I had night-time events with no memory of them. I typically had one event every few months, but some were potentially deadly.  Yes, I too cooked all the time with no memory of it.  I would wake up and crack eggs in the sink and food on the table.  I also (VERY IMPORTANT), would go on line, send e mail that was highly damaging and/or embarrassing and have no memory of doing it until I got responses. ALSO NIGHT DRIVING WITH NO MEMORY of the event."	27-Apr-10

64569	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been on Zoloft since I was 21 and I&#039;m now 31. One day I woke up with intense crying, depression, anxiety , fear of family and friends dying and self harm . My personality is one of a very happy go lucky girl and I refused to live with this nightmare. So my doctor put me on 50mg Zoloft. It took about a month for it to work and I had the tiredness, yawning , feeling completely out of it , to waking up and feeling amazing . I have tried to come off Zoloft throughout the years and man the side affects suck ! Intense anxiety, feels like your brain is exploding and vertigo. If you do decide to come off make sure you&#039;re under the supervision of your doctor. To this day zoloft has helped me and I will be on this for the rest of my life."	25-Feb-16
128609	Phentermine	"I had results taking phentermine; I immediately had energy and felt like my old self again, as I had been recuperating from a joint replacement and had put on nearly 25 lbs!  The weight came off slowly, about 2-3 lbs a week at first. By the 5th-6th week, I noticed I had lost 12 pounds. I&#039;m now into my 8th week and have lost a total of 17 lbs. I really feel phentermine boosted my metabolism, which has always been slow, as well, as I have not been able to do much exercising due to the surgery. Hopefully I can continue taking phentermine so I can reach my goal to lose 30 lbs."	21-May-15
95972	Sertraline	"Anxiety hit following 18 months of anger/grief. I was 36 years old and over a period of just 1 months anxiety spiralled out of control - developing a fear of driving and being alone - nearing not leaving the house. Shrink prescribed Zoloft, the first week was bad. I remember massive weight loss, insomnia and excessive yawning. These side effects soon disappeared and six weeks later this miracle pill started to kick in. Started on 12.5mg and have slowly increased over nine months to 175mg. Now 1 yr later returning back to normal, anxiety did get worse at every increase of dose before getting better. Give it time it will work. Exercise and CBT also helps heaps."	12-May-13
72282	Tramadol	"It works for migraine headaches, back pain, osteoarthritis pain.  Using Ultram 50mg to 300mg daily.  When I had surgery I took Ultram 100 mg four times a day and my pain was controlled.  Great medication."	9-Mar-13
96177	Sertraline	"Greeting from England!  I have been taking this medication for over 5 years now and cannot fault it.  A lot of people think this medicine &#039;numbs&#039; emotions but it made me feel like a new person.  I only take 50mg, but this has made all the difference to my life.  No side effects at all. CBT was useful as well. I tried Prozac but it had a severe effect on me."	26-Jan-12
140955	Escitalopram	"I take lexapro because my wife turns me nuts. Yes, I got depressed because I have been opressed, by her. So I started taking lex, now I don&#039;t care about my wife&#039;s outrages.  I think it is her that needs it. Also my libido is down. That is a down"	6-Mar-16
78418	Allegra	"Good so far.  This is my first use of the 180mg tablet.  Since this has been a mild winter, I have been fighting allergies and bronchitis for months.  Tussionex and Cheratussin neither one worked.  I&#039;m still coughing, but not at much.  The only problem is, I can&#039;t go to sleep at night."	17-Mar-12

138571	Phentermine	"I have used Phentermine after both of my babies to lose the baby weight. The first time I lost 30 pounds in 5 months. This time it has only been 8 days and I&#039;ve already lost 11 pounds! I have never experienced any negative side effects, I am thirsty and drink a ton of water, I have zero appetite so I have to force myself to eat, but I also feel energized, focused and extremely happy while on Phentermine. I always recommend this to my mommy friends who want to lose their baby weight as well."	22-Mar-13
64677	Sertraline	"I took 50mg for anxiety yesterday, about an hour later started feeling really weird, spaced out and nervy. Spent all night tossing and turning, sweating and unable to sleep. Persevered this morning with the next dose as didn&#039;t want to give up at the first hurdle, but today I&#039;ve felt even worse: depressed, anxious, sweating, pounding heart and extremely nauseous, I&#039;ve completely lost my appetite and can&#039;t even face water. Been told could be 4-6 weeks of this before meds kick in. No thanks, I&#039;m going to stop them and try St John&#039;s Wort."	5-Jan-16
96146	Sertraline	"My wife had major mood swings.  Irritable, would stay angry for days about the smallest things.  No sex drive, tired all the time.  An hour after taking the pill, she was a different person.  Happy, more affectionate, less tired, funny, easy going.  A miracle. She said she had always felt as though she was living her life under water or in the clouds and this medicine made things clear.  It&#039;s be wonderful. Only side effect has been some bruising."	25-Oct-11
72229	Tramadol	"I have to take more than the normal dosage for any pain to be relieved. I do not take it every day though. However, you notice when the tramadol is leaving your system when you take an extra pill or two because the pain will come back threefold. Also, I have no clue why,  but I have trouble peeing after taking tramadol no matter what the dose, it&#039;s weird."	29-Jul-13
128261	Phentermine	"I started my weight loss journey on December 28, 2015, weighing 250 at 5&#039;4 On January 13, 2016 I started taking 30mg Phen.  The first two weeks without Phen, I lost 5 pounds (3 one week, 2 the next) . I cut my calories and walked 2 miles 5 days a week, which is about 40 minutes of fast walking for me.   After taking Phen I was HARDLY hungry. Before it seemed  like my 1600 calories a day wasn&#039;t enough because I would wake up and go to bed hungry. After taking Phen, I would average about 700-1000 calories a day and I felt fine. I have so much more energy that I increased from 2 miles to 2.5 miles and it takes me 47 mins. In the next two weeks of taking Phen and sticking to my diet, I lost a total of 9 pounds. 5 one week, 4 the next. It works!"	28-Jan-16
128868	Phentermine	"In my last post, I had lost 8lb in 2.5 weeks. Starting weight was 181lbs, I currently weigh 168. I have been on Phentermine for about 6 weeks. I have had a busy summer, in which I would usually gain weight however, I have continued to lose even though my busy schedule makes it hard to work out every day. Currently down 13 lbs! I will begin to increase my workout schedule as I am not as busy anymore. Hoping to lose another 10-15lbs within the next 8 weeks (maybe more!)."	16-Jul-14
138737	Phentermine	"I started using it in April, at the beginning of April I weighed 200lbs. At the end of April I weighed 182. I didn&#039;t take it for the next month and still weigh 182. I am starting to take it again, so hopefully I can keep losing weight.   When I started to take it I felt a little addicted. Couldn&#039;t go to sleep and got moody, that all went away after the first week of taking it. And now I love it. I exercise every so often, but try to do activities more than exercise. If you do activities that keep you up and moving, you can lose the weight.  As far as food goes at first I couldn&#039;t eat much and didn&#039;t want anything greasy, it made me want healthy food. I try to eat very little amounts of food that is fruit or something with a lot of protein."	4-Jun-11
71745	Tramadol	"In all honesty the first time I had tramadol for pain it did nothing for me. It was after my hip surgery. It didnt work for my surgical pain 4 years ago. But the last surgery I had *gallbladder* removal it worked amazingly well.  I&#039;m not sure why it just did. I requested to be put on it bc the hydro codeine stopped working. I didn&#039;t want something stronger I wanted something different. And this last time I fell down my stairs. My hips get stiff sometimes and stop working properly. When this happens I fall down alot. I manged to bruise my lower back to my hip. Doctor gave me tramadol for the acute pain from the bruises on the hip. And it&#039;s been wonderful I can move no pain from stiffness I can move in ways I haven&#039;t been able to in years"	28-Nov-16
128065	Phentermine	"I started this medication a little over a month ago. I seemed to have a lot more energy at first and as of today I&#039;ve lost 10 lbs. A few days ago however, I began experiencing chest tightness and shortness of breath. I went to my PCP who then sent me to the ER. I completed multiple tests and stayed overnight in the hospital for evaluation. Everything came back without any definitive answers as to the symptoms I&#039;ve been experiencing. Several doctors mentioned that they believe the Phentermine to be the cause and recommended that I stop using it. It is now day 4 without taking any and I&#039;m still feeling the same symptoms. Only time will tell... if I feel better after a week then I suppose they were correct."	27-Jun-16
140791	Escitalopram	"I have been on Lexapro 10mg about a week and a half.  I was on Pristiq and Lexapro last week to transition off Pristiq &amp; had a good week.  Now I&#039;m just on the 10mg Lexapro and feel nauseous, have no appetite, increased anxiety, and very depressed.  I am hoping this works for me better than the Pristiq but I&#039;m worried I made a mistake.  Will these feelings pass?"	18-Aug-16
140738	Escitalopram	"It simply worked.  I couldn&#039;t sleep, had serious GI problems and developed depression over a period of months.  Less pro helped pick me up at low dose in a few months.  Was off in a year and probably could have been sooner."	28-Jul-16
141009	Escitalopram	"I was given Lexapro from my GP for anxiety which I had tried to manage naturally the past two years with various techniques to no avail. My panic symptoms were with me everyday and often suffered panic attack episodes.  Made it extremely difficult to do  everyday type stuff let alone work. I  was always drug resistant..the kind  of person who wouldn&#039;t even want to  take a headache med so the thought  of a drug therapy I would do everyday was  scary. Anyhow, its early on less  than two weeks and I haven&#039;t even  experience any real side effects  apart from a little tiredness first  week. I feel less anxious already, no  attacks and my thoughts aren&#039;t looping in my head anymore. I&#039;m  hoping it continues to get better!"	4-Feb-16
72034	Tramadol	"I wish doctors would prescribe for  lower dosages of opiate withdrawal instead of the also highly addictive methadone &amp; suboxone. IT WORKS.  While quitting &quot;cold turkey&quot;  from morphine, I discovered that tramadol takes away about 80% of withdrawal symptoms. I took tramadol  and lopermide for 1 week, then completely quit the tramadol. It was a life saver."	8-Jul-16
96057	Sertraline	"I started on 25mg for couple of weeks then went to 50mg. Started having more side effects such as bad headache that lasted for several days. Have kind of numb feeling, don&#039;t want to go out and socialize much. "	10-Dec-12
140430	Escitalopram	"Anxiety lifer here. My demon has gotten cruel in the past few years by manifesting itself in severe premature ventricular contraction (PVC&#039;s) every time I start to leave the house or get in a slightly stressful situation.  After a massive panic attack on a flight home from London to DC, I decided I had enough. I told my GP I want to go back on Lexapro. Like every other time, Lexapro works almost immediately for me - my PVC&#039;s and agoraphobia have muted drastically on only 5mg a day! Yes there is slight weight gain and potential sexual side effects but I&#039;ll take those over the other stuff any day. It&#039;s cliche but I do feel like I have my life back. I even ventured out for a run around the city tonight with zero PVC&#039;s. Sucks being on a drug but I&#039;m ok with it today."	25-Jun-17
64487	Sertraline	"Went to a therapist who suggested Xanax and the doctor refused to do that and gave me Zoloft so I gave it a shot. First week was hell, was falling asleep sitting up which I had never done before. I was tired, sick feeling, and dizzy among other side effects. Once these subsided my panic attacks stopped, however I was sleeping 20 hours at a time, waking up then four hours later going back to sleep another 20 hours. I did notice I became better in social situations yet I lost interest in things I enjoyed doing and left the house even less than before. I have been diagnosed with GAD, panic disorder, agoraphobia, social anxiety, major depression, dermatillomania, and trichtotillomania. Not worth the negatives to fix only a few of these."	11-Jul-16

Both my legs are filled with chronic blood clots threw my groin and I also suffered PE. in December. I  was going to my Pain Dr for 2 years telling him it&#039;s not working for me. All he seemed to do was tell me he was not going to put me on anything else... So I gave up and feel left out like the trash my my Medical Dr. I did every nerve test and they came out fine, I went to at least 10 different Drs not just for my pain but my &quot; Green Fitler &quot; as well and Blood Drs and so forth .. to be told that the nerve test  they gave me wont show this type of nerve pain I am in agonoy 24]7 I cry my self to sleep most nights and suffer greatly ."	22-Aug-16
78434	Allegra	"I started Allegra-D 12 hour in 1999 for allergies that left me with migraines &amp; a neck so stiff that I could barley turn my head. Allegra-D 12 hour was a miracle &amp; one tablet a day brought me back to fully functional.  It worked great for 15 years. But in summer of 2015, something changed. I would get a box that didn&#039;t work as well, then a box that worked just fine.  I emailed the manufacturer to ask if they had changed binders / fillers that might make it harder to metabolize the active ingredients. Of course they said &quot;no&quot;.    Since summer of 2015, Allegra-D has been about as effective as taking a sugar pill. Don&#039;t waste your money. Email the company, demand they go back to the old formulation."	20-Aug-16
65008	Sertraline	"I have recently experienced a most unusual muscle reaction when I try to go to sleep. It&#039;s like my legs twist and contort, and I have no control over them.  I recently reviewed side effects of Sertraline and noted this on several occasions in their warnings."	6-Feb-15
71807	Tramadol	"I have back pain every day of my life.  My doctor prescribed Ultram.  I took it for a few weeks and the pain never subsided at all.

95683	Sertraline	"I have been on sertraline for 4 weeks and a day, my dr started me on 50mg, then after 3 weeks and 3 days she upped my dosage to 100mg, I have felt the side effects so I know this medication is doing something, however, I don&#039;t feel any better for taking it, I thought by now it would kick in.."	6-Dec-14
64370	Sertraline	"Took one 50mg tablet as directed and I have never felt so iIl. Had to get down on the floor, could not lift my head off the floor, felt like I was going to pass out and felt nauseous.  Had diarrhoea; pins and needles in hands; hot flushes - the most unpleasant side effects. Could only lay in bed and even then the room was spinning. Took 24 hours to feel normal again."	27-Jul-16
140515	Escitalopram	"I have been on Lexapro for just about 3 years. I was first diagnosed with both depression and anxiety my sophomore year of high school, after I had missed weeks of school due to these conditions. After just the first week on Lexapro I felt better. Eventually, I had to have my dosage raised as I started to feel anxious/depressed again. I&#039;m now a freshman in college, and couldn&#039;t be happier with what Lexapro has done for me. I&#039;m actually studying to be a psychiatric nurse to help people like myself, with mental disorders."	29-Oct-16
95836	Sertraline	"I have now been on Zoloft for a solid 12 months (50mg).  It has changed my life.  I was prescribed it for depression, anxiety and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder - it has almost completely resolved issues I have had for most of my life.  I hesitated in taking it due to side-effects mostly because I have always been obsessed with my weight. I&#039;m happy to report that if anything, I have dropped weight in the last year. I no longer am tempted to binge eat and just lead a healthy and active lifestyle because I am happier. I really wanted someone to read this who was in my position - who was too scared to try it because of side-effects. My only side effects are dry eyes, I need to sleep 8 hours a night (instead of 5-6) and that&#039;s the worst of it!"	29-Dec-13
141006	Escitalopram	"I remember reading all these reviews before I took it because I was so scared of the side effects that I might get so I thought I would review it. I know everyone reacts differently but so far this medication has been great. It has slowed down those over thinking anxious feeling&#039;s a lot! The side effects were minor. Mild digestive problems, occasional yawning episodes (a bit annoying). The one that is probably the biggest issue is the complete loss of appetite, I just feel like drinking a lot of water. I don&#039;t feel hungry and have lost 2kg in the 3 weeks I have been on it.   I am hoping in time these side effects will eventually go away. They are pretty mild and something I can put up with since it is helping me with my anxiety."	10-Feb-16

95929	Sertraline	"I have had mild depression and anxiety on and off my whole life. I also have PMDD. Bi polar disorder and alcoholism runs in my family including my dad and his mother who were formally diagnosed between the ages of 35-45. My dad and best friend died tragically and suddenly as a direct result of his addiction last summer. I was already taking 100mg a day and my doctor increased my dosage to 200mg. This little pill has saved my life! Without it, I honestly don&#039;t think I would have been able to cope. I work a demanding full time job and also attend school on my days off. It has been tough, but thanks to this wonder in a bottle, I have been able to manage!"	22-Aug-13
141055	Escitalopram	"Incredible medication. I don&#039;t wake up in a panic  anymore, whereas it was occurring almost daily before. The first few days for me were hell, but I just slept through the headache and nausea and dizziness and now it&#039;s one of the best things that&#039;s ever happened for me regarding my anxiety disorder and panic disorder. Reduced daily anxiety = less panic attacks. Lexapro is awesome."	29-Sep-15

72280	Tramadol	"I went to a orthopedic surgeon due to carpal tunnel in my left handed, which is my writing etc. hand. Doctor said surgery was the only way to go.  I started doing research on the computer adamant not to have surgery.  A doctor prescribed me tramadol 50 mg. Took for 3 weeks 1 x daily and ate pineapples daily along with zinc, garlic and muscle joint cream and within a month I am back to normal.  Its amazing what you can learn."	24-Mar-13
141084	Escitalopram	"I suffer from severe social and general anxiety. Started on lexapro about a month ago. Took 10mg daily for 3 and 1/2 weeks with little results. I would always check these reviews because I saw how much it had changed many people&#039;s lives so I was trying to stay optimistic. side affects were tough the first week but went away quickly. Not much help with anxiety, all I really noticed was a &quot;cloudy headed&quot; feeling all day. Don&#039;t give up taking it though! This drug does wonders for many people."	21-Oct-15

71691	Tramadol	"I was given tramadol for back pain. It does not do much for the back pain but I noticed that is sure did something for my energy level and focus ability I have chronic fatigue I have severe fatigue all the time no matter how little or how much rest I get. I find that taking 100 mg of Tramadol when I get up and a 50 mg around 2 pm keeps me focused and feeling like a normal human being who can get normal human being things done all day. I explained this to my doctor and she now has stopped prescribing it to me because I am not using it for what she gave it to me for. I am so mad. I feel like a scolded child. I am a 45 year old woman who found something that worked for the condition that was depressing me to say the least because I was so tired just moving around"	4-Jun-17
72383	Tramadol	"Had surgery in 01, then I re herniated my lumbar discs.  I use a tens unit, pain patch, and lots of aspirins.  My doctor prescribed Ultram 50 mg 2x a day or as needed. Haven&#039;t taken it everyday because I get sluggish at work. Works great for the pain, but makes me VERY tired. Also, I wake up in the middle of the night and can&#039;t get back to sleep."	22-Sep-09
138592	Phentermine	"Adipex(phentermine) is great for weight loss.  I did experience minor side effects (i.e. dry mouth, insomnia.) I have taken this medicine on and off for several years.  I noticed rapid weight loss the first time I took it, losing over 30 pounds in the first month.  I was 202lbs when I took it the first time and after only 1 month I was down to about 170lbs.  I went off of the medicine for several months, didn&#039;t exercise and returned to my original eating habits, regaining all of the weight plus some.  The second time I took it I didn&#039;t experience the same rapid weight loss I had with the first attempt, only getting down to about 182lbs. Going for try #3 but will do it right this time with exercise and diet change for life!"	4-Feb-13
72314	Tramadol	"I started taking tramadol for chronic shoulder pain after I broke my rotator cup, and found it works about as good as Vicodin. I have since realized it improved my mood much like hydrocodone does, big plus. I just hope I don&#039;t develop a tolerance like on Vicodon. I&#039;ve also realized tramadol decreases my appetite during the day which is another big plus. I highly recommend this medicine for pain if they are reluctant to using narcotic pain relievers."	7-Sep-11
214562	Escitalopram	"I have been on lexapro for about 6 months. I started on 5mg then 10mg then 15mg which is what I am on now.  For the first few weeks it lowered my mood but now I am a whole new person and it was completely worth it.  I am so focused on work, enjoy socializing so much more now, appreciate music, it has really lifted my mood from a 4/10 to a 10/10. I still have bad days every now and then but nothing compared to before.  My social anxiety has also almost completely gone and people at work comment on how confident I am. I started my job after about 6 weeks of taking it so they never knew me before.  I think its really good how it has made me so focused and goal motivated too at work and in life, I am really happy I started this medication."	17-Oct-17
127867	Phentermine	"I am a 26 year old,5.3 female and weighed 177. I have always struggled with my weight and it is very depressing. I started taking the medication on Friday 12/9/16. So far it seems to curb my cravings, but I have a headache and trouble sleeping. Advise?"	12-Dec-16
141940	Escitalopram	"I have had less mood swing, and less night sweating since I started taking Lexapro. I feel more in control of my emotions and am able to think clearer."	18-Nov-09
127776	Phentermine	"I first started taking the pill when I heard about it from a friend. I was iffy of course because results may vary. I saw my doctor discussed with her why I was requesting the pills, although she did advice me that everyone is different some people may lose some people may gain at the beginning, which just made me feel a little scared I mean after all my intention was to loose not gain .....So my starting weight was 225 I&#039;m 5&#039;2 and 26 years old mother of 3 . I started around November 2015 with a low dose first two weeks I was extremely exhausted no energy but I did notice some of my pre pregnancy clothes which I have not worn for quite some time actually fit...

64816	Sertraline	"I have been on Sertraline for the last 4 months..started on 50 mg then 100 mg and now 150 mg..I was very wary of taking anti depressants as I had tried citralopram several years earlier and as soon as sexual side effects kicked in I gave up..figured I&#039;d rather be miserable but still able to perform..Most recently I became more and more down, could barely face work, felt completely bleak and uncomfortable in most social situations..Since starting with Sertraline it has been a very up and down journey to say the least..at first quite a lot of side effects..bad stomach  (2 days) trouble sleeping (would wake early and be unable to go back to sleep) some weight gain and a loss of sex drive..I got to the point where I thought &quot;your having all the"	15-Jul-15

I&#039;m loving how fast the weight is coming off, but I don&#039;t really have any increased energy I was hoping to have. However, the weight is coming off and my appetite is suppressed so I guess it&#039;s doing its job. Hoping for the next 51 pounds to come off just as fast!"	10-Aug-15

64090	Sertraline	"Hi. I felt like posting here because I saw multiple reviews by people who had taken Zoloft for a few days, or a few weeks, and had bad experiences. I wanted to say that, though everyone is different, it will take at least a month or two before you start to feel &quot;better&quot; on any Anxiety med. Also, probably starting with a small dose and working your way up after several weeks would be a good idea. My GP told me to take half a pill, then go to a full pill after a week, which is crazy, and I had just about every side effect and dizziness for the first month. The second time around with Zoloft, I took one fourth of my pill, and ramped up every four days. If you have side effects, know that this is normal, and you will feel better soon."	22-Mar-17
142038	Escitalopram	"My mom died when I was 4 and last semester I always had anxiety in the background and now at 15, spring semester of &#039;08 I had some mild panic attacks and worry, nervousness, sadness and excessive shyness all day long. This medication is a life saver and I love it. They say 8 weeks for the full effect and sure it might re-balance your chemicals in 8 weeks, but give it a chance as it still takes a while after that for you to break out of your shell."	22-Nov-08
63844	Sertraline	"Have been taking Sertraline for 3 months and it has changed my life. Was prescribed it for anxiety which had led to depression. Was hesitant to take it (bad experience with Cipralex 7 yrs ago - no emotion/ loss of inhibitions) but my doc said this had less side effects and prescribed 50mg. 1st week was horrible, nausea, spaced out, twitching etc, Libido was 0 and had anorgasmia (like you&#039;re not depressed enough!) Noticed an improvement in energy after a week, things felt lighter and I was able to think more clearly and from then it&#039;s just been a steady improvement. 3 months in the depression is gone and my anxiety is at a normal level. I still feel emotion and best part is the big O came back after about 8 weeks!"	4-Nov-17
96261	Sertraline	"Another poster said that Sertraline made her a better person.  That&#039;s really true for me. I wish I had started taking it years ago.  I don&#039;t get the full benefit with less than 100mg per day. Unfortunately, I have to stop taking Sertraline as I have a worsening spinal condition and I have to take NSAIDs (ibuprofen) for pain control.  When I take the two drugs together I bruise so easily that I worry about more serious bleeding.  For me, Sertraline has also reduced my libido.  I&#039;m a male in my 60s but I&#039;m not yet ready to give up on sex, nor is my wife."	26-Apr-11
96279	Sertraline	"To be honest I started taking Zoloft due to  my sex drive; my husband said that my sex drive was too strong for him. I always wanted it and he did not which made me feel rejected.I noticed that my OCD was under control and I am not feeling jumpy or angry at little things. Far as my sex drive, that is gone (smh) Though it was something that I wanted he is regretting this. I guess now he realized that he should have given in instead of holding back."	6-Mar-11
140987	Escitalopram	"I took this for depression.  I give all anti-depressants a 0 because they don&#039;t relieve depression naturally.  escitalopram had some bad side effects.  After taking it for a while I got lethargic and apathetic.  It increased my appetite.  I had a couple of times where I experience extreme rage which I think was because of it."	19-Mar-16

138533	Phentermine	"This is so awesome reading everyone&#039;s reviews. These are real reviews to me. You read other diet adds, they are not real. I started in late August, 28 2013. I have lost a total of 15lbs so far! Looking to lose more. I was near the 200 lb mark. It&#039;s been like that since I had my last child in 2005. All this time I had been working out, I saw no changes. I needed a change because I have insulin resistance. That is scary to me. Diabetes runs in my family both parents. I love this pill!. It&#039;s amazing how much energy I feel. I did feel jittery when taking at first and not feel hungry but I ate anyways. I watch what I eat. Insomnia and dry mouth. Drink lots of water. I just want to feel better about myself. "	5-Oct-13
140721	Escitalopram	"I started on 5mg and my doctor just moved me up to 30 today  (an increase over about 8 months).  Every time I start a new dosage, I feel amazing for a few weeks, like a new person, and then it slowly fades off.  Both my doctor and psychiatrist say this medicine will work well for me, we just need to find the exact right dosage for me.  My mom is on 20mg twice a day, has been for 10+ years, and it completely changed her life too.  With other meds I tried, had severe nausea, diarrhea, headaches, etc.  With every dose increase of escitalopram I had some &#039;chronic yawning&#039; for a week or so which was annoying, and I still have pretty bad restless leg syndrome most nights.  Weird and annoying symptoms,but I&#039;m happy to deal with them for the results"	16-Aug-16
119755	Ambien CR	"Ambien CR assists me in falling asleep but only briefly, often waking after just 3-4 hours. When it does work, I don&#039;t recall things like getting up to turn on lights and the TV full blast! I have also experienced dizziness, loss of motor skills and next day grogginess/sleepiness. Today I woke to find my small craft table smashed on the floor all the craft items scattered on the floor. A crash like that would most certainly have awoken me right? Well no it didn&#039;t and I don&#039;t recall knocking it over! So it had to be me while sleepwalking again! I have turned to taking it only when I am truly desperate for a decent night&#039;s sleep!  "	18-Aug-10
64798	Sertraline	"My Healthcare Provider switched my 20mg daily dose of Lexapro to Zoloft. I was to completely stop Lexapro and begin Zoloft with a dose of 200 mg daily.   That was 6 months ago.   I am not having a good experience with Zoloft. My dosage was adjusted down over a period of 3 weeks to 50 mg.   My mind was constantly whirling with anxiety, my mood was total chaos, swinging from depressed to mad.   My alcohol consumption was increased both by quantity and frequency.  My appetite increased in the frequency of hunger and the amount of food I consume, but I never seem to hit the full feeling.  I am seesawing between 100 to 200 mg daily at this time, trying to totally stop Zoloft.   Main reasons; weight gain (30lbs in 4 months ) &amp;  increased alcohol craving"	5-Aug-15
141567	Escitalopram	"Works for me. I did suffer from loss of appetite, weight loss, vivid dreams, headaches and tiredness within the first month of it but after that all leveled off and my anxiety was lowered. I was on the 10mg."	19-May-13

139010	Phentermine	"On June 1, 2009 I started taking Adipex-P 37.5 MG. I have now lost 15 lbs. Going from 196.2 lbs. down to 181 lbs. I was hoping to lose much more, but I also know that if you lose weight to fast you can put it back on fast. I work out 6 days a week for about 30 to 90 mins. I will be going to Doctors office on Wednesday for check up."	29-Jun-09

127520	Phentermine	"I was having trouble conceiving so, I had tests done, DNC (just to clean the inside and make sure it was OK), got put on a fertility pills but they made me gain weight. I started adipex July 18th weight was 305 pounds. I&#039;m always thirsty with dry mouth, quit drinking everything except water and coffee, only eating low carb foods, and when I get hungry I only eat little portions and I get full faster. I do not have a job and don&#039;t exercise everyday but I&#039;m constantly doing something or going somewhere and the meds have really helped in my weight loss, self confidence, and changed my life style. As if August 17th I am down to 289 pounds, I have lost 16 lbs in 1 month. Currently on month 2 will post as weight loss continues."	19-Aug-17
140649	Escitalopram	"I went through a life threatening situation. I couldn&#039;t sleep, eat nor get my body out of flight fight mode no matter all that I tried (yoga, meditation, accupuncture, herbal remedies) I got sick and tired of the every day battle with my mind and body so I sought medical help. It was the best thing I ever did! Cipralex took 6 weeks to kick in @5mg dose (I took clonazepam to counter the increased anxiety side effects for first 2 weeks). I got brain zaps, spacey headed, sleepy and had dry mouth. It all went away within 3 weeks. I Took it for a year.. A slow wean is key to minimize coming off side effects. I did it over  4 months. It takes time to build up on your system, don&#039;t give up as weeks 1-4 are rough. After that, you reap the benefits"	13-Apr-17
72119	Tramadol	"Started taking for back pain took two doses and ended up in hospital with halucinations, dizziness, and feeling faint. Shortly after that my body started shaking uncontrollably from the inside making my legs feel like I had ran for days. "	2-Feb-14
204082	Escitalopram	"Suffering from daily and day-long anxiety and occasional panic attacks, Lexapro 10mg definitely made a difference within less than a month.  I wasn&#039;t as anxious or worrisome all the time and my patience was much better. Because it&#039;s also for depression, I also found a change in my mood for the best.  Unfortunately, after a few months on it, I plateaued, so I guess.  I&#039;ve tried weaning myself off very slowly in a span of 3 months at least 3 times.  Each time, I get the brain zaps, which can be a bit cool but gets annoying.  After a few days of that comes the manic psychosis.  I get so ramped up and irritable and argumentative...it goes away within 24 hrs of taking a dose.  SO here I am, still taking it."	21-Mar-14
63833	Sertraline	"MIGRAINE SUFFERERS BEWARE: this medication took my migraine condition to another level of pain and frequency. The worst part is that my doctor did not share with me that Zoloft can make migraines worse before I started the medication. I had at least 2-3 days every week that not only was I completely incapacitated by the pain of them (something typical with migraines) to the point that I could not go to class, but the vomiting and nausea was relentless. I lost 15 pounds on this medication after taking it for just 6 weeks because of the vomiting from migraines. I went to the hospital toward the end of trying Zoloft because of dehydration and the worst pain I&#039;ve felt in my life from the migraines this caused. be careful if you have migraines"	21-Nov-17
141690	Escitalopram	"After trying numerous SSRI&#039;s and mood stabilizers and ready to give up, I tried Lexapro. It was new and just on the market. I love it. It has completely turned me around. I&#039;m normal again. Its good for anxiety too. No bad side effects. No weight gain. Its wonderful to have finally found a medicine that actually works. I hope it never stops working."	4-Dec-12
141015	Escitalopram	"I started using this medication for GAD and for depression. I started off with 5mg for two weeks and gradually worked my way up to 20mg. The first week of side effects was terrible: insomnia, nausea, mood swings, upset stomach. But I continued taking it as recommended. I used it for about six months and saw no positive changes. I experienced many suicidal thoughts, strange dreams, sleepless nights, sleeping too much, and crazy mood swings. This almost caused my boyfriend and I to break up. I would not recommend it, but it may work for someone else. I am on an SSNRI (different family: Effexor) now and have no side effects."	29-Jan-16
141824	Escitalopram	"I tried Lexapro because I was very high strung, was easily angered over the most minor incidents and was always worried about everything. Was hoping for any sign of relief. I didn&#039;t really notice any significant improvements in the first few weeks but I&#039;m on the fourth month of taking it now and what a difference. It&#039;s not like a light bulb went off and I completely changed. I still get angry and worry but it goes away easily. You just don&#039;t care as deeply as you used to. For me it&#039;s worth it. I wouldn&#039;t call it a miracle but it most definitely takes the edge off. I am thrilled with it."	26-Aug-11
96364	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been generally anxious most of my life but about two years ago I started getting probably 3 panic attacks a day, I couldn&#039;t fall asleep, and I felt nauseated from morning to night. I&#039;ve tried my fair share of drugs and Zoloft was the worst for me. My anxiety was gone but I felt like I was having pre-menstrual mood swings 24/7. Most of the time I felt angry at everyone and everything except at night when I was extremely needy and sad. Plus food was constantly on my mind. All I wanted to do was eat. And after I finished eating I would still be hungry. All that eating mixed with not wanting to get up and do anything caused me to gain weight.  For me, Celexa works a hell of a lot better."	27-Mar-10
71945	Tramadol	"Thumbs up! I was prescribed Tram for abdominal pain, and in the process of taking once daily, 50mg, I realized that my energy is boosted, my mood is elevated, and I felt 10 to 15 years younger. I also observed more creativity and a heightened sense of wellbeing. Must be the serotonin higher levels."	17-Jul-15

65006	Sertraline	"I could do a commercial for this medication. It has completely turned everything around for me. I have always had anxiety, but it became significantly worse after having children. I feared being alone, ruminating thoughts, insomnia, panic over the insomnia, feeling like the worst mother, feeling like I couldn&#039;t care for myself or my children. I fought taking medication for so long. I finally gave in. I started with 25 mg and moved up to 50 mg. I began to feel better in a week, and I felt the full effects by 4 weeks. It has given me my life back. I&#039;m happy. I&#039;m not stressed. I feel normal again!"	11-Feb-15
95935	Sertraline	"I have been on sertraline for about 2 months now. My doctor prescribed them 4 months ago but I was very reluctant to take them as I had read that the side effects could be pretty awful. For the first week I didn&#039;t feel great at all, mainly restlessness and slightly heightened anxiety but after the week they fully wore off I found it took about 5-6 weeks until I really noticed a change in my mood but I definitely feel loads better than I did before I started sertraline. I was prescribed 50mg to start off with and yesterday got prescribed 100mg as I still don&#039;t feel completely myself yet, but I do feel a million times better. I haven&#039;t taken 100mg yet as I am scared I get worsened side effects but I am going to try them tonight."	14-Aug-13

My side effects have been mild. I have also been on a low carb diet. It is December 23 and I&#039;m happy to say I have loss 15 pounds."	23-Dec-13
72108	Tramadol	"For relieving pain especially after a surgery like TKR, I found Tramadol very useful. However, as this medicine causes severe constipation, you should be careful in using it continuously. I am taking 50 mg only at nights, and trying to control pain with an NSAID during day time."	26-Oct-14
127492	Phentermine	"SW: 260, CW: 205, GW: 160 My doctor prescribed phentermine on May 15, 2017. I have been taking half of a 37.5 mg pill in the morning and half in the afternoon. That coupled with daily exercise and a 1,400 calorie diet has resulted in a 55 lb weight loss in 4-ish months! There are side effects: nervousness, elevated heart rate, dry mouth, and constipation. However, these can be handled via your healthy lifestyle! Drinking about 4 liters of water a day solves the dry mouth and some of the nervousness (just always carry a water-bottle with you). For the constipation, I just take fiber gummies twice a day, and it does the trick! This has been an amazing health journey! If I can do it, you can too!! Keep working hard!"	10-Sep-17
127824	Phentermine	"I recently was given phenteramine 37.5 mg;  When going on family vacations in Mexico, I always covered up by the pool and never attempt to venture into the ocean, embarrassed of what I looked like in a bathing suit. It is an Awful feeling being 42 y/o with 2 girls and not enjoying vacation. I am currently 200, and today is day 3. I haven&#039;t seen any movement on the scale yet. I have been well under 1200 calories with lots of lemon water, 2L daily. I am always on the go, walking due to my job. I realize it is only day 3, should I have seen some loss?"	17-Jan-17

I&#039;m generally happier. Low days are few and far between. Confidence improved and my obsessive thoughts almost ceased completely. Did not experience weight gain. No real side effects I report. This medication helps to get your mind sorted and the rest is up to you to work on yourself."	8-Apr-13
64354	Sertraline	"I was taking 100 mg of sertraline. This medicine didn&#039;t really help with my social anxiety, in fact it made it worse. I also couldn&#039;t enjoy things that I enjoyed prior to taking sertraline."	12-Aug-16
141612	Escitalopram	"Started Lexapro 5  weeks ago for General Anxiety Disorder. After going through the anxieties for 3  weeks, and then feeling emotionally flat for about a week plus, things just started getting better. The worrying thing about and obsessing over the medications &quot;mental&quot; side effects eased off. It&#039;s easier now to take things as they come, talk and interact with others, and I feel at peace with myself for the first time in years! Anyone considering stopping this medicine during the 1st few weeks, give it time, it actually does get better. I nearly stopped but kept with it, and now I&#039;m actually happy again! Everyone is saying it&#039;s nice to see me smile again."	8-Feb-13

64323	Sertraline	"This was once of the worst experience of my life. I was prescribed this to help with my mental health. All it did was make things loads worse. I felt suicidal, my anxiety went into overtime I definitely don&#039;t recommend this. I hope anyone researching this will stay well away. Dreadful stuff."	24-Oct-16
64975	Sertraline	"Have suffered from severe social anxiety for about 10 years, was so bad I would be sick 2-4 times a day, everytime I left the house, couldn&#039;t eat in public (or even in front of my family if It was a bad day), couldn&#039;t go on public transport or into shops, was a NIGHTMARE. I&#039;ve tried Prozac, citralopam, diazepam, st johns wort, 5HTP, counselling, CBT, reflexology, group therapy, hypnotherapy, Drama classes, psychiatrists, movement therapy....you name it, I&#039;ve done it, I went on Sertraline expecting it to be exactly like the other, make me feel horrific and then just dull my feelings, wow I was wrong, it is BRILLIANT, felt crap for a few days and I find it hard to sleep but apart from that I feel like a totally new person! I LOVE IT!"	19-Jan-15
71662	Tramadol	"Tramadol does two things - relieve pain and alter mood.  It affects opioid receptors in the brain and gut, and acts in the same way as a serotonin uptake SSRI / SNRI drug.  So, it makes you feel good and acts like an anti-depressant.  For short term use (very short) it&#039;s useful, but it is highly addictive in spite of what the docs and FDA say.  The withdrawals are insanely awful if you have taken it for more than a week or so - since you are withdrawing from an opiate and an anti-depressant.  Unbelievably, medical professionals are still prescribing this drug as non-addictive and non-habit forming.  If you have serious pain - take opiates - resist any attempt to give you this drug."	21-Apr-17
64261	Sertraline	"I was recently giving this in addition to wellbutrin to help with anxiety and depression. I was to take 25 mg a day for 4 days then move up to 50. right off the bat I noticed that this made me tired but when I took the 50mg dose my stomach got upset and I threw up about an hour later. Slept a long time. I woke up and felt some of the worse depression I had felt in months. I felt extremely tired, no appetite, angry, no drive, foggy headed. I&#039;ve never had any success with basic ssri&#039;s. I was prescribed this medication over 10 years ago. It was a failure then and it is a failure now. The only AD I can seem to tolerate is wellbutrin. I don&#039;t see the doc for a while until then I will be using other tools to combat my depression."	20-Dec-16
72310	Tramadol	"Really great medicine for my anxiety, originally my doctor prescribed this for pain, but I find its better for anxiety. Be careful and when you need to stop taking the medicine you need to taper off very slowly, or else. Very uncomfortable withdrawal syndrome - you need to taper off. "	21-Sep-12
64235	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been suffering crippling anxiety since divorcing a sociopath and having life throw some seriously scary shit at me. I&#039;m a single mother with no family to support me and as I suffer social anxiety too - not many friends either.     I felt less anxious quite quickly - and even had a few &#039;normal&#039; moments which I haven&#039;t had for months so I was hopeful. However, after just three days I noticed I was sweating more, and feeling agitated. Then I had the worst night ever of constant palpitations, panic, with terrible dreams when I did eventually sleep. I must have got up like 10 times to wee. I was super jumpy - a small sound in the night would have me almost hitting the ceiling with the sudden panic. Not good - stopped immediately."	18-Nov-16
138754	Phentermine	"I&#039;ve been using phentermine for 3 weeks and I&#039;ve lost 13 pounds with no exercise that being said I don&#039;t just sit around all day either. And I have not changed what I eat at all but it just makes me eat so much less and not be hungry. Also listen to the label when it says eat afterwards. Days when I took my pill on a empty stomach I felt tired and sluggish all day.  But once my stomach shrunk and I&#039;ve gotten used to my new eating habit I have no problems other then the dry mouth gives me bad breath so I&#039;ve been brushing like three times a day. Also I&#039;ve been told that when you stop if you are not on a good diet and exercise schedule you will gain it all back.. Just something to keep in mind...overall great product!"	31-Dec-12
34173	Tramadol	"I have adhesions related to multiple abdominal surgeries and some nerve damage as well. I was on Vicodin for 6 months and was referred to a pain clinic. Being a nurse I had seen Ultram used in the hospital with good pain control. I suggested I try it and stop the Vicodin. It was an incredibly easy transition and the benefits were immediate.  I too have noticed a definite mood stabilizing. I was having mood swings on the Vicodin that were affecting my relationships with others. I feel calmer and my pain is nearly gone at 200mg daily. I am so thankful for having relief. I think it&#039;s a wonderful drug."	7-May-09
139161	Phentermine	"I began talking Adipex since March 10, 2009.  I am down 14 pounds.  I found that after a couple of weeks I was getting a tolerance to the medication. I stopped taking it for two days and the weight started to fall off again.  I exercise at least 3 times a week by walking and running on my treadmill and using stretch bands.  I feel great. I still have twenty pounds to go, but I am eating MUCH healthier and do not crave junk food anymore.  Make sure you change your eating habits so you don&#039;t gain the weight back when you get off the medicine.  This is just the jump start that I needed to get back in shape after having two kids."	2-Apr-09
72498	Tramadol	"I have been taking Tramadol HCL for severe anxiety and clinically severe OCD. This medicine really works wonders for anxiety and my Psychiatrist has me on this combining it with Risperdal and Xanax XR and Xanax IR. But, before I combined Tramadol HCL with those other medicines I was taking the Tramadol HCL alone and it knocked my anxiety down to more tolerable levels and helped me ignore my obsessions from my OCD more."	7-Apr-11
141609	Escitalopram	"Mid life generalized anxiety disorder. Prescribed Lexapro 5  weeks ago and it&#039;s finally working. I feel normal for the 1st time in years. 4  weeks of anxiety and flat emotions. But the flat feeling is normal, not the excessive swings in feelings and mood that often cause great anxiety. Things don&#039;t bother me so much now, and the racing thoughts don&#039;t cause much problem. Just stop them or write them down and don&#039;t feel overwhelmed by things to do. Lexapro is a real life saver, just wish I&#039;d been able to try it several years ago, the BiPolar misdiagnosis really caused problems. Anyone thinking about giving up this medicine during the 1st few weeks, stick it out, I did and it&#039;s a miracle!"	9-Feb-13
34148	Tramadol	"This is the only medication that has relieved the pain due to osteoarthritis, in my knees.  A side effect I had was sleepiness and drowsiness."	22-Jun-09
119745	Ambien CR	"Well I have been on Ambien CR 12.5 mg for close to 6 years now and absolutely love it. I think it is the best thing since sliced bread. I developed insomnia when I started doing shift work and tried everything under the sun starting with melatonin, Benadryl, Restoril and all the new ones that have come out since and although some were helpful with helping me fall asleep, they did not keep me asleep past the 3-4 hour mark..so the Ambient CR has been great for me."	5-Sep-11
127398	Phentermine	"I started Phentermine 30mg in October 2017.  As if November 2017, I am now on Phen 37.5. Starting weight 237, now 222lbs.  So far, so good.  one thing I noticed today that I was eating even though I was not hungry.  If my mind states I should eat, I did.  That stopped today after gaining 3 lbs back this past week.  I have increased my water intake and stepped up my exercise routine from 30 minutes to 45 minutes.  Hope this helps me reach my goal."	10-Dec-17
141514	Escitalopram	"I have been severely bipolar since I can remember. My emotions controlled me instead of the other way around my whole life. It&#039;s tough to convey my struggles in a short quip. I am on 20mg of Lexapro and for the first time in my life (34 yrs) I feel normal. I take it before bed with Unisom. My life has changed drastically in one month. I went from drinking and drugs 2-4 times a week to waking up at 7 and keeping a schedule. I notice and feel a huge difference in my thoughts, not racing. I noticed that symptom gone immediately. Mood swings, gone. Depression, still shows itself but more moments of peace and clarity. I am a happy gal."	16-Jul-13
128711	Phentermine	"I started Adipex 4/16 exactly 6 days ago. I started at 181lbs I am now down to 176.4lbs. I have had occasional headaches and dry mouth, but as long as I keep losing this weight I need to lose I can deal with it.  My goal is to lose all my pregnancy weight I put on with my second baby. 28 more pounds to go!!"	22-Apr-15

128473	Phentermine	"Day 4 on Phen, haven&#039;t lost 1 ounce! I know that&#039;s not a lot of time but I see most people lose right away. Even if it&#039;s just water weight, I expected to lose at least a lb. It does do a great job at suppressing my appetite. Maybe too good. I don&#039;t eat very much because I am just not hungry. Hoping I see some results soon!! Dry mouth is annoying and I am tired most of the day but awake at night."	2-Sep-15
72009	Tramadol	"It&#039;s a great alternative for people with stomach issues as it causes no GI  upset.  You do have to eat, it can make you nauseous if you don&#039;t, but I can&#039;t tolerate anti depressant or strong opiates, so this does the trick for moderate chronic pain. Not a good choice for severe pain or post surgery."	10-Sep-15
128689	Phentermine	"Started diet on 4/12 (236.8 lbs) using my fitness pal app 1200 calorie diet. Lost 8.3 in 7 days.

Last seven days I lost 4.4lbs so the weight loss slows down after the first weeks.  I&#039;ve been running 3 miles every other day and workout 3-4x a week. Drink plenty of water. Goal weight 175lbs. I&#039;m on a 600 cal a day diet and I rarely go beyond 450 calories. No side effects, I take weekly pics, huge difference even over the last 7 days, I look 10 years younger already. I&#039;m 45."	5-May-15
138525	Phentermine	"I was a hard core Atkins dieter in my early 20&#039;s, lost a tremendous amount of weight, and kept it off for 5 years.  I then got pregnant, stopped eating healthy and gained everything back and then some.  Now I&#039;m in my 30&#039;s with my highest weight being 218.  I started back on the Atkins and started exercising but my weight was not coming off like it did when I was in my 20&#039;s.  My doctor prescribed phentermine and I&#039;ve lost a pound every day, I&#039;m finally out of the 200&#039;s and down to 198 today (never thought I&#039;d see the day).  I have had dry mouth occasionally  with no other side effect.  I&#039;ve been exercising and eating low carb and feel great.  I hope to be 135 someday."	22-Oct-13
96986	Ambien	"I experience insomnia in that my mind often does not &quot;turn off,&quot; I tend to keep thinking once I lay down in bed. Over the counter sleep aids have been ineffective and leave me drowsy the day after. Ambien turns off my mind and I sleep well. Sometimes I wake up in about 5 to 6 hours, if I need a bit more sleep then I take a half pill (5 mg) for the remaining two extra hours of sleep that I need to feel well rested. I have had no side effects."	30-Aug-15

138925	Phentermine	"I&#039;m a 66-yr old female who started phentermine in August.  I lost 12lbs the first month, 6lbs the next month, then 4lbs, and this month only 1lb! Just read all the blogs &amp; I&#039;m going to stop the medicine for 3-4 days then start again.  At my last Dr. visit he upped my dosage to 2 tabs/day.  According to the blogs, I&#039;m taking the tab at the right times of the day and in the right way.  I have an extremely active job and am on my feet 5-1/2 hr non-stop 5 days/week; however, am getting ready to start traveling with my husband in our RV so plan to start exercising by joining Curves/walking.  I&#039;m thrilled with the way my appetite has decreased, don&#039;t think so much about food, and only eat fruits and veggies with regular meal at night.  Constipation is awful."	6-Dec-09
96235	Sertraline	"After working with a therapist for 4 months to overcome my panic disorder and obsessional thoughts, I realized I needed some extra help.  I began to take Zoloft, first at 25 mg to ease into the symptoms, and later increased to 50.  I began to notice relief from symptoms after about 2 weeks of taking the medication.  I still have bothersome thoughts that circle in and out through my mind during the day, but the nausea and the heart pounding that comes with the thoughts does not happen anymore. I am able to recognize my symptoms as those of panic disorder and can move forward feeling positive.  The only side effects I experienced were headache and nausea the first few days. I am going to continue therapy and hopefully one day overcome this."	10-Apr-12
204075	Escitalopram	"After being diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder, my doctor prescribed me Lexapro. I was very skeptical.  I finally took it after having a few days with me debating whether or not to take it. It made me feel a lot better. I&#039;m only a few days into it but I can feel a difference. I&#039;m a little dizzy and find myself yawning when I first take my dose of 10mg, but that usually goes away. I also had to use the restroom several times, but overall not a lot of side effects. I&#039;m surprised and pleased so far and I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll have to up my dose in a few months."	6-Apr-14
141196	Escitalopram	"I felt better during the day after about a week, but the side effects have been unpleasant. Mainly the lack of sleep. Since the first day I started I couldn&#039;t get a good quality night sleep. Only 2 weeks in and I&#039;m already feeling how I did before. Did the depression and anxiety go away? Yeah, for a short time. But it just gives me this fake happiness that I can&#039;t really describe.  Its like a lot of the sadness goes away, but so does many other good feelings. I may be because of the lack of sleep/appetite/sex drive, but all in all, hasn&#039;t really helped me."	1-May-15

96096	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve  been on Zoloft for about month now,  I was suffering from Depression for a few yrs now. I&#039;m 30yrs. About 4 months ago I became severely depressed and suicidal. I finally went to the Doctor to start something. My depression was horrible. The first week I began taking this my suicide thoughts stopped. I still had a hard time getting out of bed but I wasn&#039;t feeling this horrible despair, I was just depressed and continued for the next weeks. I knew I felt a little better. About 2 days ago I started feeling better, I was able to get out of bed easier, and stay out, I do have trouble sleeping. But I feel okay. This medicine has saved me."	3-May-12
141336	Escitalopram	"I wanted to share my experience because when I first started taking Lexapro I read these boards daily searching for hope. I have always had anxiety but it was not until this summer that I started experiencing physical symptoms, I was constantly nauseous, often felt dizzy, and my heart would flutter in my chest non stop. I thought I was losing my mind and going crazy.  This led to depression and a feeling of hopelessness. I went to the doctor and had every test in the book done and nothing was wrong. I was then prescribed Lexapro and the first couple weeks were rough.I started on 5mgs for two weeks and during that time I was also taking .25 Xanax a day while I got used to the Lexapro.I am now two months into 10 mg and have never felt better!"	10-Jan-15
96042	Sertraline	"I have been on Zoloft 50mg for about 6 months now. I got on it because I could not control my anger. I would go from okay, to completely angry in just a matter of moments. Everything and anything would set me off, and I couldn&#039;t control it. So, I went to the doctor and he put me on Zoloft. I have lost close to 40lbs since being on the medicine beacuse I have no appetite anymore. I do not feel like a zombie, instead I am able to control my anger better. I still get upset and angry, but I don&#039;t lash out like I used to. I feel like I have control of my life now."	15-Jan-13
64981	Sertraline	"I have had depression since I can remember. Lost lots of relations because of it. Got on it eleven years ago and have more friends then ever."	5-Jan-15
140617	Escitalopram	"I&#039;m 19 and my first week on escitalopram 5mg was hard. I felt worse than ever, my anxiety got worse, I had suicidal thoughts that I never had even though about before and I couldn&#039;t leave my bed. I was tired , had head aches and had a clenched jaw and got very jittery and my sex drive had gone completely, I am now on to week 3 but can already feel a difference. Already I feel more normal and my anxiety isn&#039;t to bad right now so I&#039;m happy I kept on using the tablets and hopefully it will get me fully back to old ways soon and can feel more me again. It gets better so don&#039;t give up on them !!!"	24-Jan-17
95776	Sertraline	"Been on this medicine for 2 months 50 mg, feel so much better and much more relaxed. So much better than Prozac which made me very full of anxiety."	30-Aug-14
96099	Sertraline	"Zoloft pretty much saved my life. I was suicidal due to my trauma and many life failures. I hated the medicine at first, though. The adjustment period is horrible. I felt constipated, sweaty, sleepy, high and dissociated from the real world. Once you get past that (it takes a couple of months), it is great. I am so much more relaxed now. I used to be very aggressive and now I think about other people&#039;s feelings. Being depressed from my trauma, I was very tired. Zoloft made me more tired until I adjusted to it. Now it actually gives me energy."	1-May-12
96211	Sertraline	"I had been dealing with anxiety disorder and panic attacks for about one year. My doctor put me on Prozac - which gave short term relief but then terrible panic attacks. Since going on Zoloft I have seen a 100% decrease in panic attacks and anxiety. This medicine worked for me when nothing else would."	12-Jul-11
34172	Tramadol	"I had a severe toxic eruption from this medication. The inflammation, severe burning, itching, pain, and later the flaking of skin. It was horrible."	10-May-09
128549	Phentermine	"I took Adipex (37.5) from February 2012-April 2012 and in that span of time I went from 300 lbs down to 170 lbs. That is a loss of 130 lbs. I hardly ate  anything but grilled chicken, fruit, and powerade. I walked at least 2 miles everyday. I got Pregnant at the end May 2012 so I had to stop taking it. My baby is now 2 years and 5 months and my weight has gone back up to a very uncomfortable 240 lbs. I still exercise regularly but not as often as I should. I have an appointment in 3 weeks to get adipex again and I am hoping and praying that I have the same results as before. This is a great aid in loosing weight for anybody who struggles with loosing weight by diet alone. Wish me luck...will update in 90 days!!!"	5-Jul-15
140962	Escitalopram	"I experienced dizzy spells ,was drinking lots of water, and had a foggy brain, but once my body got use to the drug being in my system, I haven&#039;t had any panic attacks.I am feeling much better.My experience with escitalopram is a positive one."	26-Feb-16
142015	Escitalopram	"I am a 42 year old male who suffered from drug abuse, severe depression and social anxiety disorder. While seeking help for crystal meth addiction my psychiatrist prescribed Lexapro (10mg then 20mg). It took over 5 months of daily use before I started to feel better but now I can say that Lexapro has really changed my life for the better. I have been crystal meth free for two years now and actually enjoy being alive. I also interact with people much more and look forward to the future. Minor side effects included bruising (when taken with aspirin), trouble sleeping, increased sweating and hyper-activity, all of which disappeared after lowering my dose from 20 to 10mg. This medicine has been a life saver."	10-Apr-09
64763	Sertraline	"I just started taking this medication for anxiety and panic disorder it seems to be helping already but I&#039;m only on 25 milligrams going to up it to 50 tonight I hope it works if anyone can give me feedback I would appreciate it"	19-Aug-15

96031	Sertraline	"I have been taking Zoloft now for a couple of months. I started at 25mg for 7 days and then 50mg for about 6 weeks. Now I am up to 100mg a day. I have been diagnosed with panic disorder and agoraphobia. I have noticed a difference in the anxiety I have when I am at home, but I still struggle to go into public without supplementing with Ativan. I have just been prescribed Buspar, so I will be curious to see how that addition helps my anxiety. In the past, I have tried Celexa and Wellbutrin which did nothing for my anxiety. I will continue to take the Zoloft, but I would like to get rid of the Ativan if at all possible."	23-Aug-12
96009	Sertraline	"I first used Zoloft in 1999 for post traumatic stress disorder. At that time I was on 50mg, it allowed me to function very well. Now I am being treated for Major Depression, Anxiety, and PTSD. I started 50 mg 7 days ago, today I am to up my dose to 100 mg. The only side effect I have noticed is tiredness so far. The one benefit is I have not cried everyday which is a triumph as I had been doing that on a daily basis several times per day. Still am anxious about large crowds and overly watchful of my surroundings. I will post again after my check up with my progress the end of February. Good luck to you and I wish you recovery, we all need that."	31-Jan-13
140530	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve had anxiety and severe panic attacks for a year now. 10 mg helped but still had attacks on the weekend. I just started 20 mg so hopefully that will stop them completely! The two weeks of side effects (headache, insomnia) are worth the end result!"	12-Jan-17
140713	Escitalopram	"Lifted my mood within the first few weeks of taking - upped dose from 10mg to 20mg but didn&#039;t see any change. Kind of flat-lined after that (felt like a bit of a zombie).

127499	Phentermine	"Been on Adipex-p for 28 days and have lost 20 pounds. Doctor put me on it because I am menopausal and have a hard time losing weight. First week had a hard time sleeping but now no problems, I check my blood pressure daily and no issues there. Definitely get dry mouth with it that has been my only issue, I usually chew gum and keep a drink handy. Glad I was given this drug, doubt I would have lost what I did without it."	5-Sep-17

140825	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve had panic and anxiety really bad for 18 years. Some days where ok and other days where terrible . I forgot really what normal felt like. In 2012 it just got worse. Panic attacks every day.  I couldn&#039;t control it no more. I broke down and seeked help. My Dr put me on lexpro.  I was super scared at first to take it because of all the storys on the internet about it. I had a few side effects, but nothing to bad.  Best thing I ever did. Been on lexpro for over two years now and not one single panic attack. I feel like a totally normal person, it&#039;s great. My life improved 100%, and that&#039;s no lie."	7-Jun-16
139039	Phentermine	"I am on week four and have zero side effects. The first three days I was a bit jittery, but that&#039;s it. I have tons more energy and have stopped craving carbohydrates and alcohol. I eat much smaller, healthier portions and am exercising more. I have not experienced the drastic weight loss others have, but so far it seems to be steady. I was down 4 lbs after two weeks. I&#039;m hoping for more weight loss at my weigh in this week."	29-Apr-09
141405	Escitalopram	"For me escitalopram works great. Its truly a miracle in a bottle. I am usually a complete basket case and very short tempered. My irritability is out of control. I just went through a super crazy situation and I feel so calm and at peace. I&#039;ve only taken 2 doses and for me personally I can see a difference. Everyone has a different reaction but mine has been positive."	30-Jul-14

141323	Escitalopram	"I have been on escitalopram for about 2 weeks and stilling feeling the anxiety..BUT I know I have to give it time to work and not rush the good feeling it will give in  time.  I was thinking maybe I need 20mg instead of 1.5mg. May visit my doctor to confrim.  I know it works and time will tell."	27-Jan-15
78450	Allegra	"I have been suffering from hives on my face (very embarrassing) from food allergies for the last few years. Since I gave birth to my first child it became worse. Finally an allergist suggested I take 60mg of Allegra everyday and for the last week I have been almost 100% hives free. My face is so clear and white again! I feel amazing and confident again thanks to Allegra."	19-Aug-14
140580	Escitalopram	"Was absolutely awful for me. After 1 pill at the lowest starting dose I experienced horrible anxiety, insomnia and panic attacks in the morning so bad I was worried I&#039;d have to go to ER for my heart. Prescriber told me to halve the dosage and this only somewhat lessened the effects. I could not tolerate this med at all."	28-Nov-16
96263	Sertraline	"My 14 yr old son began taking this three months ago to address irritability and OCD related to Tourette&#039;s. He also has ADD. At first I thought it was a God send.   Benefits: Helped his OCD and irritability and anxiety.  Issues: Increased his impulsivity - big time, bruising on legs, stomach pains, diarrhea, constipation.  Taking him off this medicine mainly due to the behavior issues and other side effects."	14-Apr-11
142105	Escitalopram	"10mg of this medication in the morning did wonders for my anxiety and depression.  I felt awful physically and mentally and it made me feel WAY normal again.  The side effects I experienced were heart palpitations, increase in stomach acid, occasional nausea, minor drowsiness, and dizziness upon standing.  None were bad enough to quit. "	7-Mar-09
64874	Sertraline	"This drug was awful! I took it for less than a week, and it intensified my anxiety severely. Because I took other SSRI&#039;s which did not cause me to have side effects such as this one, I would prefer not to try and see how long it takes for sertraline to reach full efficacy. This drug is NOT for severe anxiety. I implore readers to try Escitalopram (Lexapro) instead for GAD. Zoloft may treat depression, but it may definitely worsen anxiety!"	9-Jun-15
140880	Escitalopram	"I have been on escitalopram for about 4 1/2 months and I am finally anxiety free. I wanted to share my experience since I constantly read reviews here and it helped me realize the initial symptoms were happening to others. In the first few weeks I had an major increase in anxiety especially in the morning. I had hot flashes, ringing in the ears, bowel issues, wasn&#039;t hungry, and pretty much thought I was getting worse and should just quit. I read other positive reviews on here and decided to stick it out. I am glad I did. After about 8 weeks I felt improvement in my anxiety that gradually kept getting better. I used to obsess and worry about trivial things. I had anxiety about driving etc.. Now I am happy and anxiety free."	8-May-16
96496	Sertraline	"I have been on it for over a year.  Only problem is a problem with retarded ejaculation.  If I plan on sex Sunday I skip a dose Saturday and take the Sunday dose after sex.  It works for me."	9-Feb-09
95918	Sertraline	"Been taking 100mg of Zoloft for about 5 weeks now to treat depression and general anxiety with what also may be a touch of obsessive compulsive disorder.  I have to say the results were better than expected.  I may have experienced a placebo effect within the first week when things seemed magically better but by the second week the anxiety and depression hit again.  By weeks and 3 &amp; 4 it began leveling off and I now feel more balanced emotionally.  My mind isn&#039;t spending time fixating on things outside of my control and things have been looking up even though my personal situation has not improved all that much."	6-Sep-13
64289	Sertraline	"This medication worked wonderful for me. Totally changed my negative and depressed attitude about life. The only down side is some weight gain and very low Libido! My Doctor is actually switching me to Viibryd because of these side effects. Very scared to change medications when this one worked so well for me!"	2-Nov-16
72580	Tramadol	"After being hooked on it from cancer and heart surgery, I find myself unable to come off the  drug and be able to sleep. I am now stuck on 200mg a day"	2-Dec-09
139186	Phentermine	"I started Adipex in August 2008. I recently had my follow up visit and lost 11 lbs so far with little exercise. Yes, it does give me extreme energy and suppress my appetite. When I first started taking Adipex, I had severe dry mouth and couldn&#039;t sleep (didnt feel sleepy). Now I make myself go to sleep and don&#039;t have dry mouth. It&#039;s been a month since I been on this medication. I have noticed I&#039;m losing inches from my &quot;love handles&quot;."	23-Aug-08
140507	Escitalopram	"Escitalopram (Generic for Lexapro) has completely changed my life for the better. I was always angry, in a bad mood, I snapped at my husband, my kids, my dog annoyed me. I stopped caring about my looks, I rarely smiled: unless I was drinking wine. My marriage was in shambles! It wasn&#039;t until I reached rock bottom and my husband threatened to leave me that I sought help from my doctor. I am so happy and thankful that I did and that my doctor prescribed me Lexapro. I am now calm, things that once bothered me don&#039;t bother me anymore. I am happy. This medicine has saved my marriage and changed my life. I highly recommend it to anyone experiencing the same troubles I once did. It takes about 2 weeks to work so give it a chance."	3-Nov-16
64770	Sertraline	"I wanted to update my progress on sertraline. I have been taking 100 mg of zoloft for over a year now. I still have normal anxiety and the occasional panic attack but it has made my life 100% better. I&#039;m not scared to go to work any more and actually enjoy life again.even opening my own business. I have never suffered sexual side effects and can even drink . If you need anti depressants just use them. That&#039;s what they are there for. It does not make you weak or less of a man. When you have a headache you take a pill for your head. If you have an anxiety disorder take zoloft, it&#039;s just a pill. Hope this helps anyone deciding what to do."	13-Aug-15
34269	Tramadol	"My doctor prescribed this for me for my menstrual cramps.  It helps so much. I do get drowsy but I am at home so it&#039;s o.k."	22-Aug-08
141456	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve been taking escitalopram for more than a month at 10mg daily for my anxiety disorder. Last 2 years ago I took this for more 2 months at the same dose. Last Feb I had observed that my anxiety was back again so I started to take last month. Thanks to God I feel better again now after 1 week, although there is little anxiety but not so compared before. "	22-May-14
127636	Phentermine	"I started Phentermine 37.5 on Sunday, April 30th 2017. I am 5&#039;6 and 210 lbs. My issue is that a year ago I started a desk job and I packed the pounds on quickly. I have always been a bigger person but I have never been this big. I always thought about food all day - wondering when and what my next snack/meal was going to be.  I should mention that I have been splitting these pills in half per my doctor. The first day I took it  I had lots of energy and no appetite. Like a switch flipped in my brain and suddenly I wasn&#039;t thinking about food and my stomach wasn&#039;t growling. I never eat breakfast, just drink my daily coffee and have been eating a fruit cup from lunch and then I eat dinner as usual with the family.  I&#039;ve lost 4 lbs so far!"	3-May-17
127898	Phentermine	"Hey guys. I&#039;m giving an update from 10/20/16. I am 5&quot;3 and My starting weight was 300 lbs. I am taking phentermine 37.5 mg capsule once a day since then. I am being weighed weekly at the doctors office. The first weight in was on 10/27/16 and I was weighed in at 291. So in one week I lost 9 pounds. Today, 11/3/16 I was weighed at 284.6 pounds. I lost 7 pounds for that week. So total amount of weight loss in a 2 week period I have lost 15.4 pounds. Now I do have extreme dry/cotton mouth and also numb/tingling hands and face. Not sure what the deal is with that but upon looking at the side affects that is a side affect listed. I&#039;ll keep updating."	4-Nov-16
72565	Tramadol	"I have been taking tramadol for 8 years.  Looking at all these reviews, my first response was that many of these folks are lying. However, maybe the effectiveness of this drug and its side effects are indeed all over the spectrum.  I researched the drug when first starting to use it and it had many fewer warnings and potential side effects then.  It was not considered a narcotic.  Here&#039;s my view.  It removed my pain which had me on the verge of suicide, sitting on the foot of my bed in tears.  It removed all my pain, 100% with absolutely no side effects at all.  No dizziness, sleepiness, nausea, withdrawal problems, tolerance  buildup at all.  Taking for 8 years now 100mg at 6:00am and 100mg at 6:00pm every day.  A miracle to me!"	28-Jan-10
141166	Escitalopram	"So basically since I was around 20 (I&#039;m 36 now) I&#039;ve suffered from general anxiety and horrible panic attacks, really bad hypochondria. I&#039;ve gone to the hospital thinking I was dying of everything. I graduated from an Ivy League college and suffered the entire time. Finally I decided to bite the billet and try lexapro (brand name not generic). I started at 10mg and had a week of terrible side effects including: depression, couldn&#039;t cry, weird feelings hard to describe, insomnia, increased anxiety, fatigue, all around shaky feeling. I couldn&#039;t deal with it so I started to cut the pills in half to 5 mg- side effects went away except I have increased libido (it gets annoying). No panic attacks. Still have anxiety a little tiny bit."	26-Aug-15
96284	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been taking Zoloft for 6 months now...began at 25mg. and worked up to 75 mg.  I&#039;m a person who hates being on medicines, so I tapered off to 50 mg and then tried to go back down to 25 mg.  Unfortunately the symptoms came back, racing pulse and anxiety.  I&#039;m now back at 50 mg and feel even keel.  It has been humbling for me to admit that I need this medication and I dislike how it makes you feel dependent on it, but I also realize it is doing its job.  I have lost 5-10 pounds since starting it.  The first few weeks I was in a fog and suffered horrible headaches and nausea, but per my doctor&#039;s words those symptoms did subside.  I&#039;ve not had a single panic attack since starting Zoloft.  "	14-Feb-11
95930	Sertraline	"I started Zoloft 3 weeks ago, very skeptical about how effective it would be for me. My anxiety was through the roof every second of the day. I was also taking Ativan 1mg twice a day to be able to function.  3 weeks later i am a new man.  The first week will be tough as i experienced nausea and completely lost my appetite.  Lost 10 pounds in a matter of a week and a half.  Trust in the medicine and let it work its magic.  I am currently tapering off Ativan because Zoloft is doing its job"	22-Aug-13
97302	Ambien	"Helps me sleep through the night for the first time in my life. The first time I ever took it I made the mistake of not going to bed right away so I did have some hallucinations. They weren&#039;t scary, but I make sure to take it only when I go to bed. There are some definite sexual side effects, much to my husband&#039;s good fortune. It all seems like a vague dream when I wake up. It&#039;s probably a good idea to only take it when you&#039;re living with someone you trust!"	26-Dec-09
127485	Phentermine	"So far I have lost a pound a day using this. I do crossfit in the mornings and I eat under 1800 calories a day. I also drink a gallon of water and get 8 hours of sleep everyday."	20-Sep-17
139077	Phentermine	"I&#039;ve been taking phentermine since January. I wanted my health back on track so my doctor recommended this drug. I have been working out 4 times a week for an hour. I was 260lbs and am now 212lbs. Doctor still wants me to get down to at least 170lbs so he can take my off some of my medicines and keep me in maintenance program for about 9 months. I drink lots of water, count my calories and exercise. No complaints, just happy my health is much better."	20-Mar-09
64541	Sertraline	"After two months of being on this medication, I had to wean off. I just couldn&#039;t take it anymore. You feel absolutely horrible on this stuff. Severe brain fog, unease, restless, extremely affected my cognitive abilities, etc. This was the worst SSRI I have ever taken. It did not work for me, however, it might work for you. After two months of being off the medication, the brain fog and cognitive abilities are still present, this did not happen on other SSRIs."	26-Mar-16
127560	Phentermine	"I have lost a total of 100lb in 1 year on this.  I have about 50 more pounds to go."	22-Jun-17
128736	Phentermine	"So I have always been a big girl! I have 3 kids and with each pregnancy there was added weight that just carried over and you know how the story goes...I pushed myself and my wants and needs to the side and took care of everyone but myself. The more weight I put on the more depressed I got. I got to 280lbs!!!! My body was in constant pain and discomfort and I knew I had to stop and do do something about it. I started the pills last year and lost a total of 125lbs!!! Not just the pills but I started the gym, did zumba 3 times a week and started eating good. The pills aren&#039;t the magic fix. They just help you kind of like a kick start. Sure I had side effects!!!! But nothing that would out weight being close to 300lbs."	26-Mar-15
96155	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been taking sertraline for about 2 years, it&#039;s very good, but at times is does seem as if I need a higher dose but this soon goes, maybe a bad day. For all new users stay with it, it does take time for it to work but it does after a few weeks or so."	13-Oct-11
142112	Escitalopram	"I started taking this medication 3 days ago at 10mg for mild depression and anxiety. I feel it works very well. I see the sexual side effects but I am hopeful they will go away. Other side effects went away after my 4th day (today). So far so good. I feel the black cloud lifting from head. I hope it continues."	21-Feb-09
140749	Escitalopram	"I started this medication a year ago. My Dr. started me at 10mg then bumped me up to 20mg about 3 months later. I suffered from depression, lack of motivation for life,  suicidal/death thoughts, anxiety, and angry outbursts that affected my personal and professional life. This medication has greatly improved my life and my relationships. When I first started it there was an adjustment period for about a month but now I feel like I have a positive outlook on life and I can handle everyday stressful situations without wanting to kill everyone. I actually lost weight on this medication because I&#039;m not wanting to binge eat to ease my anxiety and I am more motivated to go to the gym.  Lexapro was a life saver for me."	19-Jul-16

72348	Tramadol	"I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia in 2007 and have been taking Tramadol and Soma ever since. Using both of these, plus Cymbalta, is the only way I can function through the pain. "	8-Jan-12
96387	Sertraline	"I started having panic attacks and anxiety coupled with mild depression.  I have been on Zoloft for 10 years and have always taken 50mg.  It has literally saved my life. I had gotten to the point I could not leave my house and had run out of stores and restaurants on several occassions.  I use to snap at my kids but the medication leveled out my moods and cured my panic attacks and had worked very well for me. I recommend it highly."	7-Dec-09
138969	Phentermine	"I have been taking Phentermine for 6 months. I was 250lbs 5&#039;10&quot; male. One day got tired with shortness of breath just taking a shower, that opened my eyes that I needed help. Now I&#039;m 190lbs just taking this miracle medicine and just walk the dog type of exercise. Breakfast - Cheerios/2% lowfat milk and bagels with cream cheese. Lunch - chicken salad or shrimp salad with low fat dressing. Dinner - before 6pm - KFC grilled chicken 2pc. mash potatoes or rice. SNACK - 8pm any real fruit. AVOID ALL SODA EVEN DIET SODA, FRUIT DRINKS, ICE CREAM ANYTHING SWEET. &quot;WATER ONLY!&quot; It will be tough at first but stick to this for 1 month and you have survived. You WILL lose 10-15lbs. CHECK AND RECORD WEIGHT DAILY SAME TIME BEFORE BREAKFAST. GOOD LUCK."	25-Jul-09
127600	Phentermine	"I&#039;m 44 years old and only 5 feet tall and have struggled with my weight for over a decade. I&#039;m currently at my heaviest at 250 pounds. I was so small in high school - college 100 pounds. A friend at work lost 31 pounds on it in just 3 months. I asked him how he did it and he told me about it. I went to his doctor since my doc NEVER told me about this miracle of a pill and I just started it today. I&#039;ve read a lot of great comments about it. I do have borderline blood pressure to start with so was told to check my bp on it daily. I took one full 37.5 pill at 10 a.m. I about 2 -3 hours later I felt a little dizzy. Around 7 pm I&#039;ve had stomach upset. I&#039;m praying I loose weight on this."	21-May-17
64988	Sertraline	"This medicine has been a GOD SEND for me! Bad nerves (anxiety, panic attacks, etc.) &amp; depression run rampant on my mom&#039;s side of the family &amp; I&#039;ve suffered since I was about 14 (I&#039;m 41 now)! It was pure, unrelenting HELL suffering through that stuff at such a young age. Before Sertraline, I had tried Imipramine &amp; then Paxil. The Sertraline has been the best (&amp; worked the longest) by far but, I can almost guarantee it&#039;ll take away any libido you have. Your sex drive never seems to come back either, no matter how long you&#039;ve been on this medicine. I thought it would but, nope! It HAS made me feel &#039;normal&#039; (fine/healthy) again though &amp; for that, I&#039;m beyond grateful. Only side effects I had at first were weird dreams &amp; smell/taste perversion."	28-Dec-14
96058	Sertraline	"On about a week now and feeling like my life is changing. I don&#039;t feel like complete garbage everyday, I don&#039;t over think everything, and I&#039;m much happier. First day was the worst but then got clonazepam and it made the first period feel MUCH better. Loving it so far!"	10-Dec-12
214543	Escitalopram	"I started to to have persistent stress so much I could not concentrate on anything (I&#039;m software developer and my job requires high amount of focus). I tried exercise, eating well, deep breath without success. They were effective to decrease it a little bit but it was not enough. Then I started escitalopram (10 mg per day at 6 pm).  It was a miracle. Without any apparent reason, my anxiety disappeared. My external world did not change. I was still living in the same place with the same people, the same job; everything stayed the same but somehow I was not worried anymore. I was on it for 1.5 year. When I discontinued it, I stayed GAD free. I discontinued it because most of the external stress triggers in my life were not there any more."	10-Nov-17
127699	Phentermine	"I lost about 40lbs through changing my eating habits and regular exercise over a period of about 18 months, but I had hit a plateau. I was referred to a weight loss clinic by my co-workers, who are having great success with phentermine. After my first week of taking phentermine 37.5, I was constantly famished, and tired. At the 3 week marker (down 6 lbs), I requested to switch to Adipex. I noticed a difference the very first dose. I&#039;m on day 3 of Adipex, and it seems to do a much more consistent job of curbing my appetite, and I don&#039;t feel sleepy. I&#039;m not overly energetic, but also not jittery, and I&#039;m not getting the headaches. Trying it for a week before possibly checking into another option. So far, I am feeling optimistic."	3-Apr-17
34374	Tramadol	"I have been using this for almost a year now for peripheral neuropathy pain. This along with Lyrica and Pamalor have finally made it possible to live with somewhat normal levels of pain. Don&#039;t want to be without it."	8-May-08
64555	Sertraline	"This medication really helped my anxiety and depression. I felt so much better--but it came with a cost.  This medication gave me severe Hypoglycemia.   I am not diabetic thankfully but on this medication it made my blood sugar drop severely low where I would almost pass out at work (and I work in a factory). So I&#039;m sure you can imagine how awful I felt. It&#039;s a catch 22.  I felt better with my anxiety but then I got severe blood sugar drops.   So I&#039;m off it now and have to start all over again on a new medication.   If this medicine works for you then great, I envy you.   This made me so sick I couldn&#039;t stand it.   So if you take this medication and start getting severely low blood sugar (you&#039;ll know trust me) stop taking it!"	7-Mar-16
72406	Tramadol	"I been suffering from herniated disc, osteoarthritis, restless leg syndrome for about 5 years now, I took so many different medication but nothing helped. My husband who was recently diagnosed with MS of the spinal cord started taking Tramadol for pain. He told me that is very good medicine and was helping him with pain and his mobility. I told my doctor to prescribe it to me and he did. I take it twice a day and feel great. I am pain free and I have so much energy, I also have clear mind, I can concentrate better. I recommend this medicine to anyone who is suffering from pain. Try it and you will see what I mean."	26-Nov-10

I changed my diet a little bit by taking 2 slices of toasted brown bread, 1 egg and a fruit, lunch fruit &amp; a small portion protein, supper would only be 3 colorful veggies e.g.: carrots, beetroot &amp; spinach.  What I like about this is I can choose what I want to eat. I would highly recommend it to anyone who did not have the ability to control their appetite and crave for everything around."	23-Apr-14
127689	Phentermine	"I started taking adipex on March 19th, weighing 256 lbs (5&#039;10&quot; 32 year old female). I took it every day around lunch time ( took it for only 12 days).. Its now Thursday and I haven&#039;t taken it since last Friday because I still have NO appetite.. I have to make myself eat.. No side effects besides extreme dry mouth, I drink over a gallon of water a day.. and I weighed myself today and I&#039;m 238. So I&#039;m down 18 lbs with only using it for 2 weeks.. I find this medicine extremely helpful and am so thankful someone told me about it!"	6-Apr-17
142119	Escitalopram	"I have only been taking Lexapro for two days but I already felt a difference the first day.  It was like things were not such a big deal.  A few hours after taking the second dose I had this wave of memories from the last year that made me go &quot;wow, I&#039;ve over reacted, over thought, over cried, over expected from myself and others&quot;.  It does make me a bit sleepy so I take it before bed. My appetite is more normal now where I would eat to feel better now I am only eating when I&#039;m hungry.  It makes me thirsty and makes me yawn a lot but overall but I think this may save me and my family from my freak out moments."	2-Nov-08

141023	Escitalopram	"7 years ago I was diagnosed with leukaemia and I drifted into a state of depression. I felt really depressed and felt my life was drifting away so I visited my doctor and he prescribed me 5 mg of escitalopram. Initially this didn&#039;t make any difference and I still felt really depressed. So on return to my Doctor he upped my medication to 10 mg and after about 1week I have never looked back. I now feel like the person I did before I was diagnosed with leukaemia.  I hope this is of help and good luck to anyone who is suffering from this terrible illness please keep your chin up xxxxxxx"	2-Dec-15
141444	Escitalopram	"I had terrible symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome. When I would go out to eat within 20 mins. of eating I would have terrible diarrhea. I could chew gum or drink something in the morning getting ready for work or school and I would have diarrhea. I would on occasion have bowel accidents within a few feet of making it to the bathroom at home, when coming in from going out to eat.  The first time I was put on escitalopram for nerves, this was one of the best things that ever happened to me. I felt &quot;normal&quot; for once. I did not want to bite people&#039;s heads off and the diarrhea, gone, that department was normal for the very first time since my teen years. I started taking escitalopram in my early 40s. This medication is a God send."	17-Jun-14
128369	Phentermine	"So my Dr just gave me the weight loss pill 37.5 on 11/6/15 cause it&#039;s so hard for me to lose weight I&#039;m 30 years old and 5&#039;6 429lbs yes I know but  Anyways I also have edema so he gave me a water pill Laxis 20mg. Over the weekend I weighed myself when I went to get my blood drawn this morning and the scale said 402.2 I was in total shock but I know that was probably all of the water weight that was on my body but that was still good to me. With the weight loss pill with only being on it for 3 days now I have seen my energy increase rapidly and my appetite has gone down I have to make myself eat which is once a day and I&#039;ll have a snack but I haven&#039;t had a desired to eat any sweets or anything. I go back to the Dr on 11/20 pray for me"	9-Nov-15

The only thing I experienced was dry mouth within the first week. Since then that has subsided, but now my feet and hands are tingly. It&#039;s not severe but enough to be annoying. I still feel great. No other side effects. Since taking it, I&#039;m teaching myself to choose better foods and make smaller plates. Trying to establish good habits while it&#039;s easy to do so.  I haven&#039;t incorporated exercise in my routine yet, but I can&#039;t wait to see results when I do!  Still moving forward with it."	16-Dec-15

My GP started me on sertraline 50gms, I was very concerned about taking them, as I am very sensitive to tablets, but if they were going to help matters decided to try ! I take mine last thing at night, had none of the side effects mentioned, none at all, so fingers crossed they will help, I have been on them now nearly 2 weeks."	2-Oct-15
141397	Escitalopram	"There are a lot of negative reviews about this medicine and it&#039;s side effects, and that makes a lot of people beginning the medicine, including myself, freak out. The people having a positive experience with Lexapro are out living life. Don&#039;t be discouraged. For me, Lexapro started working in the second week, but would work on and off for the first month. I started at 5mg and slowly went up to 15. I&#039;m on week 5 and it hasn&#039;t done much for my anxiety (yet) but it has helped my moods tremendously. For the first month I had muscle aches and headaches, and I was really tired and unmotivated. That went away in week 4 and I&#039;m feeling better than I have felt in two years."	19-Aug-14
128363	Phentermine	"I have been on Phentermine for 4 weeks exactly. I have 80 pounds to lose.To date I have lost 23 pounds. I also follow a low carb Paleo eating plan.1200 calories and around 50 grams of carbs per day.I also workout daily doing cardio,for me this is more effective than walking.I have no side effects."	13-Nov-15

64539	Sertraline	"Due to long ongoing depression and Fibromyalgia my GP prescribed these meds my health has changed dramatically and Fibro has decreased."	26-Mar-16
64480	Sertraline	"i have been on zoloft for about 6 months with other anti depressants before that time.. zoloft is the only one that has worked but it is no where near a miracle drug for me.. my mind still races and there are days that i am weepy and have thoughts of suicide, i dont have any motivation to really do anything.. im not on a small dose at all 175mg/day (max dose is 200mg/day) but i can admit if i miss it for a day, i will feel it for two.. i cant really tell if there are side effects because the depression could be causing some of the lethargy.. i dont want to take pills all my life, and im doing whatever i can to try to get off them but at this time, they are my only hope"	19-Jul-16
72033	Tramadol	"Good day to you all.  First of all just wanted to mention this web-sites words really did make me laugh, that&#039;s out comments are:  &quot;.......not a substitute for the expertise, skill, knowledge and judgement of healthcare practitioners in patient care.&quot;  I have been on tramadol now for five months and I have never had so much hassle from incompetent medical professional people.    Anyhow throughout the time I have taken generic Tramadol I&#039;ve been put on two other brands and this generic is by far the best. Of the medical professionals all but one have been able to realise that there are differences with different brands. I find this by far the strongest and most powerful. There again everyone is individual so this may not apply with all people."	9-Jul-16
128659	Phentermine	"I&#039;m a female teenager looking to become a body builder. This pill is perfect. The first one I took I literally went 2 days without eating and zero hunger; definitely recommending."	11-Apr-15
139009	Phentermine	"I have the dry mouth and headache. The first day it suppressed my appetite but since then my appetite has actually increased. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s because I&#039;m about ready to start my period, or if it&#039;s because I take pain medication with it. I had lost 1 lb the first day, but none since. I have the 37.5mg tablets. I take 1/2 when I wake up and 1/2 around 2."	7-Jul-09
34198	Tramadol	"I currently use fentanyl 100 patches and oxycodone with APAP 5/325 mg. I have still been having pain thoughout the day. I started to take the Ultram ER 200 mg and it has worked very well. So well in fact that I rarely have to take the oxycodone with APAP. That is great."	4-Apr-09
141749	Escitalopram	"I&#039;m 39, male, 6&#039;3, 230 lbs. Suffered from anxiety disorder for years. Worrying, palpitations, shortness of breath, basically all the popular anxiety symptoms. Seemed to come on more when I pushed myself exercising. Back on Lexapro because it does work. Side effects like lower sex drive, difficulty reaching orgasm, insomnia all go away. I find myself fearless, my life is active, no more &quot;what if&#039;s&quot; and no anxiety attacks. I admit I hate taking medicines, but without it is far worse."	28-Mar-11
71752	Tramadol	"I started taking Tramadol for spinal stenosis and peripheral neuropathy about 11 years ago along with Lyrica.  It seemed to help the pain for several years, but I started noticing the sweating if I was as late on a dose.  After several years I wondered if it was the pain I felt or withdrawal symptoms.  This last weekend we left town and I forgot my pills.  I am cold turkey now only because I want off.  It is not pleasant, but doable I hope.  I was prescribed 400 mgs/day, but usually only took 300 unless the pain got real bad.  And yes, it did help my pain.  I was told I would be on both meds for life.  I want off the tramadol, but I can&#039;t get off the Lyrica.  I tried."	31-Oct-16
127671	Phentermine	"**** UPDATE**** My original comment was posted 05/18/2017.... I had my 1 month appointment on 05/20/2017. My weight was 219lbs. I lost 13lbs since I started. I have noticed that the longer I am taking the pill, the less burst of energy I have in the mornings. So now the only side effect I have is dry mouth. Hopefully, I can lose at least another 10lbs by my next appointment."	24-May-17
95910	Sertraline	"I have tried to battle my way through significant anxiety at work, and an increase in depressive symptoms for several years. I came to the decision that I was unable to keep the momentum of fighting by myself and saw my GP. This took a lot of courage and fighting feelings of failure as although I work in the Mental health field and recommend this type of medication for clients I was not transferring this to myself. I have taken for 5 weeks with very positive results in terms of mood and anxiety levels gradually improving, it&#039;s not perfect but I wouldn&#039;t expect that. I am taking 50mg daily. Side effects have been increased insomnia, but without so much anxiety, so it&#039;s bearable. I will continue to take for a considerable period."	2-Oct-13
138595	Phentermine	"Start taking phentermine 30mg in Oct, 28 2012-Dec, 28. I lost 10lbs. Stop taking for 1 month. Now I&#039;m back on it. Feb 1/13 side effect. Dry mouth, chills, blood pressure high. so I&#039;m going to start drinking apple cider vinegar before I take my pill with 8oz water, 1 TABLESPOON of ACV. I feel great."	1-Feb-13
140727	Escitalopram	"Its been about 6 months since I started on lexapro and so far it really helped with my anxiety. I used to be nervous over little things and get sweaty hands due to it. my anxiety was slowly but surely taking over my life and prevented me from doing the things I enjoy. the first week or two I got side effects ( dry throat, vivid dreams, tiredness) which is normal and your body adjusting to the medication. the thing about this medicine is you have to be patient. you will really start to feel great effects after a few months. I now don&#039;t feel the anxiety and pain that I used to deal with every day. I recommend this medication but it may not work for everyone. also if you stop , you will get withdrawals (know that before you start)"	7-Aug-16
140598	Escitalopram	"I developed severe panic attacks. I felt like I was dying or going to pass out. Something was seriously wrong with me.  Logically I knew nothing was going to happen but then the panic came anyone I left the house. Shaking, sweating, disorentation, couldn&#039;t breathe etc etc. Starting lexapro was hard. I started at small dose of 5mg and had to adjust to it. Nothing more than I already felt. After about 2 weeks I started to not notice I was taking anything.  And then all the sudden I was at a store and I forgot to panic,  I felt fine.  I do have panic attacks still they are not gone but better.  There are situations I still can&#039;t handle but daily living,  going to work, school function,  dinner etc I can now do."	15-Feb-17
142092	Escitalopram	"I have had Bipolar disorder since I was 14 and never knew what it was. about 4 years ago I asked my Doc for something to help with depression and he prescribed 10 MG of Lexapro. I couldn&#039;t believe how much it helped.  He bumped me up to 20mg a day (I&#039;m 6ft , 250 lbs).When I went to a rehab where they prescribed a lot more meds wich eventually had very bad side effects so I was pulled off of it and switched to welabutrin.I think this drug works great alone but watch for other drug reactions."	25-Feb-08
64644	Sertraline	"I took sertraline from 2011 for GAD, Panic Disorder, Social Anxiety, and depression caused by anxiety, and eventually weaned off in August of 2015. These past 4 months have been miserable, so I just started back up on it 2 days ago. The first time I was on it, it worked great, it just took some time to get used to. I had forgotten just how bad it was for me during the first month though...  I&#039;ve taken 2 doses now, the first was 75mg but I reacted very poorly to it so I took only 50mg with the advise of my doctor last night. After an hour of taking the second dose, my anxiety skyrocketed. I hardly slept last night at all because of nightmares and waking up in a panic. It is also causing strong nausea. Thankfully, I know it gets better."	27-Nov-15
95807	Sertraline	"I mostly used this medication for my anxiety disorder of obsessive compulsive disorder. I also used it for PMDD. It worked wonders for my anxiety. It also lessened my PMDD symptoms of strong irritability, sadness, and anger before my period. I loved it! The only downside was that it made me very tired, even on only 50mg. I didn&#039;t have much energy to workout. This made me gain 5 pounds and I eventually got off it because I love being an active person."	10-Jan-14
128762	Phentermine	"I work an off shift. I gained 40 lbs my 1st semester of college.  Im 23. 6 ft tall 38 male waist. Suffer from weight anxiety.  Been dieting and exercising 4 to 5 times a week. For the past 2 years religiosity. only got bigger and was always starving and p.oed. My 1st month after getting this med from my doc I&#039;m down 13 lbs.  My face and belly look like a past picture. I hope to see more changes. I started at 230 now I&#039;m 217. My 1st goal is 200 then my crazy goal is 180 and 34in waist. I&#039;m tired of my pants &quot;shrinking&quot;. Also  the dry mouth was a pain the 1st couple days drink lots of water. And it keeps me up at night. Running around in my brain. Then I&#039;m not sleeping as deaply as normal but its worth it I&#039;m finally eating less. And full."	4-Mar-15
97293	Ambien	"I had trouble functioning during the day because I couldn&#039;t fall asleep until 1 or 2 am, then had to get up at 6 am.  My doctor prescribed 10 mg Ambien (not CR) but because I&#039;m small I decided to cut one in half the first night.  I was able to sleep soundly almost immediately after my head hit the pillow and I slept all night.  That was about three years ago and I am still taking my half pill per night and sleeping well.   I have occasional times (maybe once every two months) that I don&#039;t sleep well with them, but I don&#039;t blame the pill for that.  Follow the directions, if you don&#039;t it isn&#039;t the fault of the drug, it&#039;s your own fault."	15-Feb-10
64459	Sertraline	"I suffer from GAD as well as OCD, with compulsions ruling more than obsessions. My grades at university started to fall and I knew it couldn&#039;t go untreated. My psychiatrist prescribed 100mg Sertraline daily and since then my grades have improved to reaching distinctions again. I am also much more calm and don&#039;t get angry as easily as I used to.   Side effects: I sleep muuuuch more and struggle to stay awake in the afternoons especially. Being a former ballet dancer, I don&#039;t have much motivation for exercise anymore. I started to note a little bit of short term memory loss (e.g. entering a room and forgetting why I had gone there - nothing major). Worst, however, was chronic diarrhoea. This motivated a change to 40mg Citalopram daily."	20-Apr-16
141081	Escitalopram	"I went on lexapro to control my depression caused by depo, and it was awful. It stopped my anxiety attacks, but I was still constantly paranoid. It helped with most of my depression. The lows were not as frequent or severe. However, it made me gain 30 lbs in a year. No amount of exercise of diet would help. I would not recommend this medication."	28-Oct-15
128629	Phentermine	"I have been on Phentermine for many months now Doctored monitored I have lost almost 40 lbs.... But tolerance seems to build up and mg needs increased - I seem to be plateauing, Overall great med for weightloss -- Although I lost a job opportunity - even though I submitted all info to company and told them I would be flagged for amphetimine in drug screening they still wouldnt hire and I submitted complaint to Americans with Disabilities act, Stop taking 6 days before pee test if trying to get a job."	18-Jun-15
141896	Escitalopram	"I&#039;m taking escitalopram known as &quot;Cipralex&quot; in the country I&#039;m in temporarily, better known as &quot;Lexapro&quot; in the States, and I&#039;ve found it surprisingly effective for my anxiety. I feel calm, relaxed, and content at almost all times. Also, I find myself comfortable in situations where my anxiety used to get the best of me. Lexapro is a true pharmaceutical innovation. I fully recommend this drug for anxiety/depression/apathy."	24-Apr-10
72277	Tramadol	"I had arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery Feb 25th 2013 and my surgeon prescribe me 10mg Vicodin 6 times per day.  After 4 weeks and &quot;wanting to get me off of narcotics&quot; he changed my prescription to 50mg Tramadol 4 times day.  Honestly I believe that I am now receiving 1/10 the relief from pain that the Vicodin were providing. "	31-Mar-13
71890	Tramadol	"I work 7 days a week, 10-14 hours a day doing hard labor. my friend gave me a 100mg pill from citra (I think) one day and within 15 minutes all the pain was gone and I felt like my mood was increased x10. I worked harder than I usually do without one and had a very fast pace. I take one in the morning when I know it&#039;s gonna be a rough day and it helps me out through the whole day, if I notice I really need another one (which is rarely) I&#039;ll take half and feel better. I stop for a week or two to not build a big tolerance and haven&#039;t felt any negative side affects or having the need to want to just go pop some. The only noticeable side affect which didn&#039;t mind much was that my breathing was slightly off, not too much; most pills cause it."	8-Feb-16
127630	Phentermine	"I started taking this in March 2014 until the end of 2015. I lost over 40 pounds but I was more so impressed with the inches I lost.

I was a compulsive eater, but now I can walk by donuts with no pain. made progress eating better and less.  I Take it first thing with water, then don&#039;t eat till late afternoon.  Seems to reduce my desire to eat. Makes me appreciate lighter foods over heavy foods.  I have more physical and mental energy.  Only negative is makes it a little harder to sleep.    Its actually possible, some day I will not be the fattest guy I know."	17-Jul-15
141853	Escitalopram	"In &#039;97 I was suffering from depression so badly, I entered a clinical trial for antidepressants. Specifically, Effexor XR. I had never been on antidepressants before and I was astounded at how much better I felt. Then in &#039;06, after the 2nd work supervisor said I had &quot;no sense of urgency&quot; I decided to switch medicines. My doctor said so many patients became apathetic after long term use. Getting off was a nightmare! But now I&#039;m on Lexapro. It hasn&#039;t lifted me up like I&#039;d like either, but maybe that&#039;s the way it&#039;s going to be. I experienced weight gain with Effexor and actually lost weight since I&#039;ve been on Lexapro, which has been for about 2 years now. Would like to get off all medicines period."	27-Sep-10
141136	Escitalopram	"I recently started lexapro for generalized anxiety disorder, severe panic disorder, and social anxiety.  It has worked wonders for me.  I feel so much better and experience limited anxiety now.  However, I just went up to 20 mg and now I can barely stay awake.  I am tired all of the time and easily could sleep through the day.  It&#039;s very difficult for me to get things done and it is getting in the way of my daily activities.  I don&#039;t want to stop this medicine because it&#039;s working so well, but I am at a loss and don&#039;t know what to do."	10-Jul-15

127772	Phentermine	"on 1/24/2017 I started taking 1 pill of Adipex 37.5mg once a day. I started at 262lbs. As of today 3/8/17 I now weigh 247lbs. It gives me energy without the jitters. I also suppresses my appetite I force myself to eat 5 small meals a day.  I also do at least a 30 min workout 4 times a week. Adipex works! My normal doctor will not prescribe this medication so I see a weight loss doctor. I pay 100.00 a month for the meds."	8-Mar-17
214578	Escitalopram	"Before taking this, I had general anxiety, worries, a little bit of OCD, a lot of social anxiety. Here is my experience: First month or so: LOTS of side effects. Massive sweating for no reason, insomnia, weight gain, I can&#039;t even remember what else, maybe GI issues.  It doesn&#039;t matter, after I made it through that period, things began to get much, much better.  Does what it is supposed to do: take away the anxiety. Amazingly. I am a different person.  Only drawbacks are: decreased libido, weight gain, and a little bit of a subdued feeling. Not sure how to explain the subdued feeling, maybe that the highs aren&#039;t has high and the lows aren&#039;t nearly as low. Actually, the lows aren&#039;t a big deal at all, which is a good thing."	1-Dec-17
64631	Sertraline	"I am 24. I had been getting more anxious and depressed from my senior year of high school. It got to the point that I was having panic attacks on a weekly basis my second year of college. I was very wary of social situations,  barely slept most nights, and just felt negative all the time. Originally I was put on lexapro and tried it for about 6 months during my student teaching semester of graduate school. The panic attacks did stop and I felt less anxious but I also felt like my emotions were way off. It&#039;s like that were trapped in a box and while I want exactly sad, I was never happy. Doctor switched me to sertraline and lunesta, then upped the sertraline after a couple of months. Now I feel the best I&#039;ve ever felt in my life!"	6-Dec-15
127566	Phentermine	"I&#039;m a 52 year old women, moderately active through golfing and walking, and a relatively healthy eater who never has dieted and didn&#039;t need to.  Menopause, age, activity level and metabolism has each contributed to a 35-40 lbs weight gain.  After a year of increased activity and reduction of calories and carbs such as pasta, potatoes and breads, I was not able to really maintain a 5-10lbs weight loss if I didn&#039;t walk at least 5 miles each day.  I noticed there was an overall reduction in energy.  My doctor had been on this journey with me; food journals to now Phen. 37.5 mg.  In 12 days I&#039;ve lost 8.6 lbs.  I do have a dry mouth and a suppressed appetite which I hope over the 3 month prescription will help me to reduce portions considerably."	19-Jun-17
140828	Escitalopram	"I&#039;m a 63 yr old female, living alone. I&#039;ve been on generic Lexapro since March 2016, 10mg. My dr. prescribed this after I described my high level of stress and anxiety, which caused sleepless nights. My extreme stress has been related to dealing with my elderly mother, who has signs of senility , but insists on living alone. There are other issues involved, but the point is: I&#039;m 90% better. This medicine has &#039;fully kicked in&#039;, and I feel like a renewed person, with a greater quality of life. Sleeping through the night, and able to function &amp; feel normal again. No words to describe the positive changes. Grateful this medicine worked for me!"	7-Jun-16
71883	Tramadol	"I will be reporting back often. I am on my third day of Tramadol and it seems to be a miricle. I have been pain free. I am taking one 50 mg tab every 12 hours. I also take methocarbamol 750 mg every four hours and Xanax 0.5 mg every 8 hours. I have not been pain free in 10 years. I am reading such bad things about tramadol on this website that I&#039;m getting afraid to take it. I thought I had found my miracle but if the side effects are true I don&#039;t want to have anything to do with this medication. Feedback please."	4-Jun-16
141185	Escitalopram	"After a shocking experience, I had sudden onset of anxiety, shakiness, nausea, insomnia, constant fear and over-reaction to sound. Also, depression. Diagnosed with post-traumatic stress. My Dr recommended escitalopram 10 mg/day. Noticed great improvement in 2-8 weeks without side effects. Anxiety is under control, not completely gone, but life is liveable. Also use behavior modifying techniques from my psychologist. I would be in a sorry state without escitalopram, a wonderful drug!"	17-Jun-15

My doctor suggested this pill and so far I love it! I weighed myself today for the first time since I started and I lost 14 lbs in just 8 days!! I am beyond excited and have been able to notice change which gives me some hope to get back to normal! The first day I took it it was a crazy feeling and I didn&#039;t think I liked it, I was also up till about 4:30 am that morning. But now a week later the only side effect I have is slight dry mouth and I&#039;ve had a couple small headaches. I love how it completely takes away my appetite which makes me not crave any junk food and I&#039;m able to eat healthy small portions!!!"	21-May-15
141593	Escitalopram	"This is the only medication that has really helped me.  I am able to concentrate much better.  I have no problems with losing my temper.  I have no panic attacks any more.

64248	Sertraline	"I started 25mg of Zoloft two weeks ago. My experience is different because I started taking it after 6 months on Prozac. On Prozac  I ended up with paranoia, obsessive thoughts and certainty that I was going crazy, but didn&#039;t recognize it as a side effect of medicine. Finally, my therapist told me that Prozac must be making me crazy. As soon as I stopped Prozac and started Zoloft i felt better. I&#039;m not yet sure if I feel better because I&#039;m off Prozac or because Zoloft is working, but I&#039;m calmer and feeling &quot;normal&quot;. Still low and worried about everything."	31-Dec-16

65007	Sertraline	"I&#039;m a 25 year old male who has been on Zoloft for most of the past 4-5 years for anxiety. At times I took 50mg but mostly I took 100mg/day.  The drug&#039;s effects aren&#039;t as noticeable until you either stop and think about it or stop using it for a bit. I like to think of it as taking the emotional peaks and valleys in your life and compressing them. While that&#039;s a good thing for bad anxiety and what not, it also is a bummer that is works the same way with positive feelings.  Quitting the drug made me more irrationally irritable but not much else. My least favorite part of Zoloft is how it kills libido and makes it incredibly hard to climax. It&#039;s got it&#039;s upside but I am currently in process of trying something else"	10-Feb-15
72478	Tramadol	"Been a paraplegic for 36 years. Lots of arm and shoulder pain from ruptures. Been on tramadol for 8 years now. 200-300mg a day. It has allowed me to have a good quality of life I would otherwise not have. Few to no side effects. An excellent pain control medicine."	10-Oct-11

Lost weight really fast during the first month (about 20 pounds). Weight loss slowed during the second month but I wasn&#039;t eating quite as healthy as the first month. I&#039;m trying to lose 10 more pounds, so we&#039;ll see how it goes! I have a little over 2 weeks of phentermine left, so hopefully it will help me."	8-Mar-14
71657	Tramadol	"I have taken Tramadol of and on for 4 years.  I stopped taking it due to kidney pain on right side.  The Doctor insisted I take it for a back injury, told it him it gives me kidney pain and dismissed it.  Forward 6 months later when I took tram I would eat greek yogurt and kidney pain would go away, then one time had no yogurt took tram and pain stayed, increased and traveled to other side.  I went to Dr who  did urine test for infection which was inconclusive, 3 rounds antibiotics, an ultra sound, 2 CT scans, still no answers.  The pain has decreased by half as long as I don&#039;t stand long or do to much activity. Feels similar to menstrual cramps but only higher up and right where kidneys are at and like someone squeezing my kidneys, also sometime would feel like kidneys swelling up."	13-Aug-17
96508	Sertraline	"I have been on Zoloft for at least 6 years. It has done wonders with little side affects. I was on 50 mg until today when I felt like I was a little depressed etc and my doctor upped the dose to 100 mg. I think I could not have gotten through deaths of relatives and menopause without it. It&#039;s a wonder drug. My mom who is 80 was on many medicines for her depression. She finally switched to Zoloft and she is much much better. If in doubt about taking it, I highly recommend it. I even quit smoking the first year I was on it."	12-Nov-08
140789	Escitalopram	"Well after 4 weeks I feel great. 46 yrs old suffered from Anxiety all my life and just had enough of living in flight or fight mode.    I was very anxious about taking any medication, reading all the  reviews prior Not sure if that helped. I didn&#039;t want to just rely on a drug but make some life style changes at the same time . So I went to the docs and asked to be reffered to a councillor. This was very beneficial as I was determined to get some tools to help with underlying issues. Lastly started moderate excersize. All this helped but like others I can say around 4 weeks, I fealt a big difference kick in. Dealing with day to day challenges , I feel just more in control and don&#039;t get the physical stress triggers.  I hope the above has helped"	19-Aug-16
95956	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been taking Zoloft for 8 years. It has created stability in my life. Prior to taking medication I always felt off...anxious, depressed, emotional, dwelling of things and this interfered with the quality of my life as well as affected my relationship and professional life. I take 50mg and I feel even keeled and normal instead of a basket case of emotion. Nobody would ever know I&#039;m taking a medication and I&#039;m often complimented on my temperament. I feel neutral, in control of my feelings and everything is within normal range. If you are overly emotional, anxious, feel off balance and have difficulty feeling consistent in your life...this could help. I feel content and normal now."	10-Jul-13
128694	Phentermine	"WOW, I am 27yrs,  5&#039;5, and weighted in at 196lbs, and I just started taking the meds on Monday plus I have been going to the gym to tone up my body, now before I even weigh myself again, I just wanted to say, You ladies have some amazing stories with taking 37.5 and Congratulations to you all with your weight loss success. Hopefully when I get back on the scale I will at least be back to my normal weight at 160 lbs (Goal results on May 23rd) will give updates!!!"	1-May-15
140801	Escitalopram	"Lexpro is the best medication. I had no life befor Lexpro. I used to suffer for 8 years from anxiety and panick attacks. I was always scared from anything. The doctor asked me to try Lexpro I was so afriad of medications, I thought medications would never help me. I used think that I will help my self to stop thinking about it. I thought they were all thoughts in my mind and I have to change them I used to get panick attacks everday when I&#039;m sleeping. I would recommend anyone to try this medication because this medication will safe your life if you have anxity I have been 10 mg for months then 15 for 2 months and 4 months for 20 Mg and am still taking it. And I will never stop taking it"	24-Jun-16
140769	Escitalopram	"I have been on this about two weeks.  I can give you an idea of what the start of treatment is like.    I was prescribed Lexapro 10mg in the morning for Depression/GAD/Panic Disorder. It has worked very well for anxiety and the panic disorder. I have become more calm and my mind is more in order and focused.  I still find most people intolerable, but that is more my personality, and at least now on Lexapro, I can stand to listen to other people talk for extended times and keep my focus.      The depression, as I discussed with my Dr, is going to take much longer to deal with, but so far, I do feel somewhat more calm and level-headed.      Side effects: Decreased sex drive.  Some tiredness."	7-Sep-16
214573	Escitalopram	"I&#039;m a 35-year-old woman and was on Lexapro 10mg from ages 21-30 and have been on 5mg for about 5 weeks now (staying at this dose) - both times for GAD without Depression and a touch of OCD.  For the most part, I managed fairly well while off it (exercise, limited alcohol, CBT therapy) but had periods where my anxiety would flare up. My advice would be to try it. I was very anxious about idea of going back on medication (i.e. Googling all the horrible side effects) but I&#039;m feeling significantly calmer, less anxious, and happier.  I didn&#039;t think I needed medication...until I went back on medication (give it a few weeks) and felt the difference.  I had convinced myself I was &quot;OK&quot; but really, I was &quot;white knuckling&quot; through my anxiety."	5-Dec-17
64197	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been suffering really bad anxiety/depression for over the past year now. My Doctor suggested me to take Zoloft at 25mg. I came across this page, and read reviews. And most were positive reviews. The first day I felt fine and energetic. Second day my anxiety was worse than usual. After the third day of taking it, I was rushed to the ER due to burning feeling in my chest, and really bad tremors. Worst experience in my life."	13-Dec-16
128430	Phentermine	"I took adipex first week of Feb 2015 wasn&#039;t really tracking the dates of how long it took for my weight to drop but it was super quick. My starting  weighed was 220 by March I was 189 and as of today October 15 2015 I weight 167. I&#039;m so happy but now I want an flat stomach so thats my next step. pants size was 16 now I can fit 9/10 11/12 so my goal is to have a flat stomach"	15-Oct-15
97169	Ambien	"It works! It was really weird at first... make sure you are IN BED shortly after you take it or you will be subject to odd behavior/amnesia.  "	29-Jun-12
71979	Tramadol	"I take it for severe lower back pain. I have to take the maximum dose of 400 mg a day and you must take it on a regular basis every four hours and you may not feel the full effect unless you&#039;ve been taking it consistently.    I am 50 years old very active and travel often the only side effect that I have is constipation if I don&#039;t take it on time my body tells me because then the pain reoccurs within 10 minutes of taking tramadol I feel fine"	12-Aug-15
96217	Sertraline	"I am taking Zoloft 50 mg since more than 10 years, to deal with depression. My only problem is that I get SLEEP FULL OF DREAMS ONLY. My Doctors have tried a lot by giving many different sleeping medications, but all in vain.  I have come across a couple of patients with the same problem.  In case any of you have faced the same problem, please share your experience. If you have been able to solve this problem (of sleep full of dreams), please let me know how. Thanks."	16-Jun-11
128161	Phentermine	"Took phentermine 37.5 for 8 weeks and lost 21lbs. My doctor has me on a 4 week break and then I can start the cycle again. Need to lose 50lbs more. Minimal side effects."	21-Apr-16
96193	Sertraline	"I started taking Zoloft when I was 16. I was sent to the hospital twice for suicidal actions and my doctors upped my initial dose from 25mg to 200mg. I was supposed to go up to 300mg but I was really sick of the dosage being upped and nothing happening. To be completely honest, it took 2-3 months to kick in for me. I&#039;ve been diagnosed with psychotic depression/possibly schizophrenia spectrum. Now that the medicine has had some time to work into my system, I&#039;ve felt much better. Not 100% my old self, but capable of functioning and taking care of myself. I wasn&#039;t able to get out of bed for days on end at my worst. The side effects are totally manageable and worth it. My psychosis apparently calms down when I&#039;m feeling less down which is a relief."	4-Sep-11
140616	Escitalopram	"Today was my first day and I feel amazing. Life is on the right track. I feel free from bondage. Small things don&#039;t matter anymore. I love the new me"	24-Jan-17
140425	Escitalopram	"I switched from Prozac was feeling amazing but there was one problem. It constipated me. I tried to stick to it but it never went away. I do suggest you try this medication because it worked amazing just couldn&#039;t handle that side effect. GOOD LUCK"	29-Jun-17
141984	Escitalopram	"After taking Lexapro for around 2 1/2 years I weaned myself off about 4 months ago.  The biggest side effect while going off of it was a feeling of electric shock in my head.  It was a super fast thing and only lasted for a super short second, but it would occur at random times throughout the day.  After awhile though, I got used to the &#039;shocks&#039; and knew they would be over in a short second and just lived with it.  I need to state that I did this very slowly, gradually decreasing my doses over a period of about 3 months.  NOT a quick process.  Initially I felt WONDERFUL after discontinuing this drug, but now, months later the depression has crept back."	19-Jul-09
34218	Tramadol	"This has been a horrible experience. I have been on this for 6 months. It was effective for one week. I felt fantastic for that week. No pain at all. But since then the constant aching in my legs has progressed to keeping me up most of the night practically in tears. Now I am stuck in the fun task of getting off the medication."	24-Feb-09
142088	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve been on several medications but lexapro is the only one that has helped. ive suffered from severe depression, anxiety,panic attacks, obsessive compulsive disorder and ive had suicidal thoughts since is was 9 years old. lexapro has helped with all of this. i still have &quot;down&quot; moments but nowhere as severe! i am able to face reality better and was able to return to school."	18-Mar-08
64003	Sertraline	"I have dealt with ups and downs, anxiety, social anxiety, depression etc. etc. for years.  My life overall is normal and I managed the episodes but I always knew they were there and didn&#039;t like feeling that way. I am married we have children combine that with everything else and it times it was just too much. The doctor suggested the Zoloft.  I was nervous at first and really didn&#039;t know what to expect. In fact I waited a month or two to even fill the prescription. The side effects  we&#039;re obvious at first. Dizziness, tired, minor confusion. I don&#039;t want to scare anyone because I still functioned , Still was able to work, I was able to take care of the kids,  everything was pretty much normal but I could tell my mind was a bit off.      After about a month the side effects faded away from me. After two months my mind became clear and my attitude towards life improved dramatically. Little things didn&#039;t bother me anymore. I started working out and that didn&#039;t bother me anymore. My wife would argue with me about normal marriage stuff but I wouldn&#039;t yell back. In fact I was able to see how foolish most of the fighting was and how pointless it was to yell back. My work life improved. My conversations with other people improved. I found myself more interested in what the person was saying and focusing more on what they were saying. At a follow up visit with my doctor he asked if I&#039;d like to stay on the medication. I told him that my life has never been better and my mind never more clear so why would I choose to stop. He agreed and was happy with my progress. He initially prescribed 100 mg but I found 50 works well for me at this point. So every night before bed I take my pill and wake up the next morning feeling ready to go instead of wanting to stay in bed.  For those just starting or thinking about starting this medication I can honestly tell you it has changed my life for the better. Initially it was rough but after a while all that fades and your left feeling really good. For me it took about two months for others it may take longer or shorter.   I hopes this helps as I read a lot about this medication prior to starting and found a lot of the write ups were negative. I honestly think those people may have other issues or conditions that this medication can&#039;t help or they may have not been able to get through the initial break in period."	15-May-17
140674	Escitalopram	"I took 5mg for three weeks and the upped the dosage to10mg. That was 7 weeks ago. I had very few side effects with the initial start up or when the dosage was upped. The reason I upped the dosage was because I read where 5mg was not therapeutic. My anxiety has disappeared completely. However, I am having a problem with the fatigue. I am going to talk with doctor about taking it at night instead of morning. Possibly need to lower the dosage. My biggest fear is insomnia. I can deal with other side effects but insomnia makes me crazy. The fatigue is not every day but hit bad this afternoon. I am also weaning off clonazepam. I took .5 every other day for four months. This month was .25 every third day. Next month .25 every fourth day."	24-Sep-16
141989	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve used Lexapro on and off for a few years and it has been great.  When getting onto the drug the side effects are minimal and were completely gone for me in a short period.  Good exercise nutrition are also essential for depression or anxiety."	8-Jul-09
141319	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve started Escitalopram 10mg 2 weeks ago and felt great on day 3 &amp; 4, after that It stopped working. I&#039;m having a hard time dealing with that, because the feeling It gave me on day 3&amp;4 was the best I&#039;ve felt all my life. I upped the dose to 20mg now it&#039;s day 3 on 20mg and still nothing."	1-Feb-15
64034	Sertraline	"My internist prescribed me 25mg of Zoloft daily as an alternative to Wellbutrin. The side effects were not worth the benefit for me. In the seven weeks I faithfully used the med I suffered from severe fatigue, inability to orgasm, weight gain, acne, and chest heaviness. As a thirty-something, in-shape mother of two, I have zero time for naps so, fatigue was not a livable option for me. I&#039;m actually really surprised by the weight gain as I hit the gym daily. The pros of this medicine would be: my sweet tooth was non-existent. That&#039;s probably it."	17-Feb-17
72450	Tramadol	"Fantastic. I finally got immediate relief for my restless leg syndrome after suffering for many months and taking other medicines like Horizant. This one did the trick for my legs and I sleep well again."	8-Apr-12

96248	Sertraline	"I have been on Zoloft for the past two months.  In that time, I have been less angry and anxious.  However, I have gained 20 lbs.  I have had gastric banding surgery and I follow Weight Watchers.  I stay within my food intake guidelines and in the past month I have introduced exercise.  I was losing weight steadily at a healthy rate before I started on Zoloft.  Even though the medication is working to help my anxiety/OCD/and depression, I am willing to try another medication because the weight gain is one of the issues affecting my moods.  It may work for some, but I am finding more and more people who have had a drastic weight gain while taking the medicine."	8-Mar-12
95826	Sertraline	"I was a mean person. In came the VA doctor who said &quot; you need something that will calm you down&quot;. It started with 50 mg twice a day. That worked. I was a good guy again even the Doctor liked me. I had no side effects. About 6 months later my wife said you need something your getting mean again. I got mad, quiet Zoloft. Well I got real nasty quick. Wife called the doctor after 3 weeks. I got a call from VA nurse, telling me I had an appointment the next day. Needless to say I was put back on Zoloft after a huge argument with Doc and wife at the office. I left with prescription of 100 mg twice a day. Still no side effects. 5 years later I am still a nice guy. It&#039;s the best thing since breathing. "	1-Apr-14
141275	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve struggled with anxiety and panic attacks since I was about 20. I&#039;m 31 now and it flared up again this year, so I started on 5mg of escitalopram after seeing my doctor. The first few weeks were really hard. I felt sick and had no appetite at all - great for weight loss! But not very nice feeling so nauseous. I also felt much much more anxious, really horribly panicky at times, I felt quite desperate. I&#039;d say it took 3-4 weeks to subside and since then I&#039;ve felt so so much better. I&#039;m calmer and more positive and less plagued by anxious thoughts all the time. I just feel like me again. It&#039;s quite an incredible medication &amp; I&#039;m so grateful that its there &amp; it works. The first few weeks are really hard but it&#039;s so worth sticking with it!"	3-Apr-15
127922	Phentermine	"I started 10/31/16...i am down 9lbs...i walk every day and eat ok....the key to your heart not racing ...cut the pill in half..take 1 at 6 or when you wake up the other at lunch.   Do not take after 2 pm"	17-Nov-16
138863	Phentermine	"I started taking this pill on 7/30/10. I&#039;m a 5&#039;4, 25 yr old female, my start weight was 144lbs. I&#039;ve been going to the gym, a minimum of 3 days a week (prior to the pills) 2-3 hr cardio classes. I was stuck on the same weight for a while, my eating habits aren&#039;t the greatest but not the unhealthiest either. I told my doctor that I had difficulties shaving off some pounds so she prescribed me the medication. During the first week or so I dropped 8lbs. I&#039;m at 136 lbs right now. My appetite has reduced immensely. I hardly desire to eat. I only eat small portions once or twice a day. The side effects that I have recently encountered for the past 3 days is a lot of dizziness (mostly when I stand up), light headed, some dry mouth (not too bad)."	10-Aug-10
128408	Phentermine	"At a starting weight w a new doctor 440 lbs. I tried adipex. I only took it a week before I stopped due to headaches, heart racing just getting up to go to bathroom. But with sheer willpower alone in one year I lost 120 lbs . After losing average 10 lbs a month my weight leveled out and I couldn&#039;t get but 5 lbs a month. So we decided to try Adipex again.  I started Aug 15 at 316 now Sept.13- 295lb.  This time no side effects I&#039;m exercising more and feeling great. Hoping for the best"	13-Sep-15
128120	Phentermine	"I started taking Phentermine in March of 2016. As of my doctors visit on 05/16/16, I have lost a total 23 lbs. My starting weight was 289 and I&#039;m currently 268lbs. The medicine does cause dry mouth, but after taking it for sometime it doesn&#039;t seem to bother me. I gained most of my weight after having my daughter who is now 4 years old. I decided to change my eating habits before taking the Phentermine. It has become a lot easier that way. My goal weight is 185. I will keep everyone posted as I continue this weight loss journey."	22-May-16

96270	Sertraline	"I have been suffering from depression for 22 years. I am 41. Zoloft has helped me tremendously. I was always angry, tired, frustrated and had a hard time getting out of bed. With Zoloft I&#039;m more sociable, friendlier and appreciative of the things that seemed insignificant. Every story is different, try it for yourself."	29-Mar-11
96539	Sertraline	"I have been taking zoloft for about 2 months and it seems to be helping me with my temper and stress level.  I have lost about 10 lbs, which is great but I can&#039;t seem to be still. I&#039;m constantly moving my feet or legs. Very figidy."	10-May-08

128189	Phentermine	"I started taking adipex on 11/14-4/15 and without diet and exercise I instantly lost 25 lbs. I weighed 150lb (only being 5&#039;2) , by the end of the first month I was down to 126lb , my goal being 125lb. I stopped for a while and ended up gaining all but 3lbs back. Now I am back on it and I&#039;m excited to see where I&#039;ll be a month from now. The side effects I have had both times is dry mouth, shakes, and short temper. I&#039;ll report back in about a month, maybe sooner."	31-Mar-16
214583	Escitalopram	"I had been taking Citalopram for over 6 years (20MG) when my doctor switched me to Escitalopram several months ago.  We started with 15MG, and it definitely helped, but my anxiety was still bad, so we decided to increase the dose to 20MG about 3 weeks ago.  I haven&#039;t had a panic attack since, but I am extremely lethargic and unmotivated.  I sleep 12-15 hours a day (I have a very flexible work schedule), and I&#039;m still tired and take naps during the day.  I make up any excuse not to do my work, and I have trouble getting myself to do ANYTHING, including going outside.  I won&#039;t even walk to the store if I really need something.  I&#039;ve always loved to sleep, but I used to be extremely self-motivated."	27-Nov-17
72521	Tramadol	"I have severe chronic fatigue. I have tried everything for relief. I have been taking Tramadol 50mg one per day for 5 years I have found this drug gives the most relief out of anything I have tried. I have no side effects at all. I would highly recommend Tramadol for anyone suffering from CFS."	5-Apr-10
138956	Phentermine	"This was wonderful for taking my mind off of food, helped reduce the stress of always focusing on what I was eating, calorie intake, and still not losing weight.  I found myself having to force myself to eat something, which was a huge contrast from eating because I was bored or stressed.  I found I was stressing over food all the time and by the end of the day I didn&#039;t want to think about it anymore more so I would just say the heck with it and eat without caring.  Now with Phentermine I have the will power with ease and don&#039;t even care if I eat and if I do it is a much smaller portion.  It is absolutely vital for success that you at least walk 20 minutes five times a week and reduce fried foods and eat more fruit and veggies."	11-Aug-09
127416	Phentermine	"As I mentioned in Part 1, the phentermine gave me so much ENERGY. I began cleaning my entire house. The only side affect I remember was a very dry throat. I&#039;ve only been on the pill for 4 days. I went to bed that night. I woke up with a rapid heartbeat. It scared me. I knew it was the phentermine. After the 2nd day, I haven&#039;t had any more rapid heartbeats waking me up out of my sleep. The pill causing me to drink more water than I usually do.(LOVE IT) I got on the scale today. SW 180lbs Nov. 8, 2017.  CW 175lbs Nov. 11, 2017. It really decrease my appetite. I haven&#039;t started exercising yet. I&#039;m just eating smaller portions."	11-Nov-17
141016	Escitalopram	"This medication was/is a life saver.  Took 2 weeks to adjust to it and about a month to feel its positive effects.  I would say it changed my life for the better BUT I now realize my weight gain over the 2.5 years is due to the medication so I will try to wean off.  I also slept beautifully on it, but too much."	27-Jan-16
34265	Tramadol	"I&#039;ve been taking tramadol for 2 years. I like it so much better than narcotic pain relievers. I don&#039;t feel awful, eyes arent heavy and not sleeping around the clock. I don&#039;t have any side effects I don&#039;t get buzzed and my pain level is tolerable and I don&#039;t dread work because of pain. I do not have health insurance available to me at the present time and its not that expensive. I would recommend this before narcotics. I have tried otc medicines without any relief. Thank you tramadol."	10-Sep-08
140662	Escitalopram	"I was experiencing bad anxiety and was on cymbalta.  My Dr switched me to escitalopram and it did not help at all. I am still  on it and now on clonazapam. The clonaz helps my anxiety 100 percent but now my depression, especially the physical symptoms like over sleeping, not wanting to eat, diarrhea, full blown depression.  Cymbalta helped all of that so now I am seeing my Dr to go back on the Cymbalta, which really helps my depression and the physical pains of it, as well staying on clonazapam.  I feel like I&#039;m in a black hole and can&#039;t get out. It&#039;s scary. I want to shake it and I just can&#039;t.  See my Dr this Tuesday thank goodness.  Hope to feel better soon."	25-Mar-17
64362	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been on 100 mg of Zoloft for 13 years now--though not a perfect fix, it&#039;s helpful, and I&#039;m very thankful for this drug.    Anxiety runs in my family but was never discussed.  I&#039;m 47 now, looking back I realize that wisps of it ran all through my childhood and youth- I &quot;self-medicated&quot; with alcohol and smoking.  It peaked when I was pregnant and 9/11 went down--midwife urged me to try meds, but I was very stubborn.  I wanted to do it &quot;on my own.&quot; After months of struggle and desperation, I finally gave in. It helped. I could parent and function again.  A couple times since, I&#039;ve tried  to wean myself off  but never successfully--always needed it.   Now I&#039;m at mostly at peace with needing zoloft--wish I didn&#039;t, but I do, and it helps."	31-Jul-16
63803	Sertraline	"this drug gives a huge boost of mental energy and confidence and is very effective for social anxiety. The downside is that is reduces your appetite and libido, and it makes you feel jittery at its peak. Insomnia is a problem when just beginning but you get used to it after a few days."	17-Oct-17
139101	Phentermine	"I agree this product will make you drop the pounds. I took it a few years ago to lose weight after having a baby. In 6 weeks I lost 17 lbs. I have gained that wieght back plus more. I&#039;ve decided to try it again. I have so much energy I can&#039;t sit still. The down side is I can&#039;t concentrate. I&#039;m very moody. I can&#039;t fall asleep for at least an hour after going to bed. Sometimes I can feel my heart beating to fast. If I don&#039;t start showing serious weight loss I may stop taking it because of all the side effects."	6-Feb-09
64620	Sertraline	"Normally I would never write a review on a drug, but I&#039;ve had such a positive experience with sertraline that I really want to help others with my experience. I&#039;ve always suffered with severe anxiety &amp; low mood, particularly in winter. I had a rough time with my PhD not going to plan several months ago &amp; started to feel worse and worse, feeling anxious and panicky all the time. After cbt failed to work, I finally agreed to try sertraline. I was terrified of taking drugs, terrified of side effects and feeling worse. Started on 50mg, had a little nausea and anxiety but not too bad. After 3 weeks my doctor upped me to 100mg. 3 months later &amp; my anxiety has almost entirely gone &amp; my mood is always good!

128784	Phentermine	"I&#039;m a 18 year old female, my entire life I&#039;ve always been overweight and I wasn&#039;t able to lose it, it didn&#039;t bother me until I gained 40 pounds in less than a year due to being on birth control. I went from 175 lbs to 215, that&#039;s when being overweight caught up to me. I wasn&#039;t noticing how much the way I looked changed. Until I went clothes shopping and I couldn&#039;t fit into a size 16. That was when I went to my doctor and he recommended Phentermine, It has been almost 3 months and so far I&#039;ve seen nothing but positive results, I lost 31 ponds so far and still going! I bought a size 13 mini skirt, it was too wide! I haven&#039;t fit into a size 11 since I was 15. I strongly recommend it, because of it I smile every time I look in the mirror now."	30-Jan-15

128915	Phentermine	"My experience was this. I was practically dying. My body was giving up. My blood pressure was 205. Pre-diabetic. LDL off-the-charts. I had joint pain, could not concentrate, acid reflex, headaches constantly to migraines, could not sleep, in dead of winter I was always too hot, would walk outside at 2am in shorts just to cool down, snoring, could not get any complete rest, and many more. I found this YT site from a Dr. William Davies, Wheat Belly. I instantly decided to quit eating ALL wheat and grains. You will be happy you did. Then I went on Phentermine 37.5mg. I was 315. Since 1/15 to 5/12, I have lost 60 pounds. I&#039;m still losing. You will find out that you need to drink lots of water because it will be difficult to urinate."	12-May-14

141809	Escitalopram	"About 3 years ago I was on Lexapro 10mg, then I was off. Then about 9 months ago I was on Lexapro 10mg again then up to 20mg but my libido pretty much became non existent. I had weight gain, I tried working out but it didn&#039;t help the problem. It worked with my anxiety but after a while I felt like it was wearing off and I was becoming accustomed. I had lost my job and had no insurance so I couldn&#039;t afford my Lexapro, so I was cut off up until about 3 days ago. The withdrawals were INSANE, I had so many attacks and brain zaps I really wanted to crash my car into incoming traffic, I would have my mom come pick me up while I would park on the side of the road."	23-Nov-10
142069	Escitalopram	"I have been on Lexapro for almost 5 months now and I am doing great. It has really helped a lot. I don&#039;t have the negative thoughts like I did and I can actually have positive thoughts. The only downside that I see is the drowsiness. But I am super sensitive when it comes to medicines that &quot;can cause drowsiness&quot;. I can function but I go around yawning a lot. That is getting better though. I have tried taking it before bed to see if that would help."	28-May-08
64919	Sertraline	"i am a Desert Storm veteran and for years i have suffered at the hands of depacote, lithium and wellbutrin (one after the other) and i just felt more and more miserable and doomed. then my doctor prescribed zoloft 2 years ago and it literally saved my life. now i am able to function normally and am really enjoying my life for the first time in 2 decades. it is my life saver and has changed my life forever. before zoloft i felt so depressed and hopeless. thank you, you have given me my joy in life back!"	25-Mar-15
64048	Sertraline	"It&#039;s so difficult looking at reviews because so many are negative. I have moderate depression and generalized anxiety disorder. I started taking antidepressants pretty young maybe 6th or 7th grade. I took lexapro, Prozac, and something else before I got on Zoloft. I just recently got off Zoloft to see how I&#039;d do without it and so far I&#039;ve been okay. Anyways, Zoloft was practically a life saver for me. I&#039;m not sure if I have experienced any of the side effects, but if I have they obviously didn&#039;t make much of a difference.  This review is here to say don&#039;t be scared to take Zoloft it might be the perfect drug for ya!"	7-Feb-17
64785	Sertraline	"I have been on this drug for 5 weeks now and i finally acquired myself. Though i had this panic attack all of a sudden, and i did not even know what panic attack is. I went for all types of heart tests etc before someone suggested to see a psychiatrist.I found the courage to go to a psychiatrist and he prescribed this med. I used to feel sad, unsure and even sort of lost at times.Good that i went to this doc without waiting for the symptoms to go on their own as one doctor had advised. I feel so good now. The reason of my posting here is that i used this forum to know about this drug and i also want to add my experience so others are also helped."	30-Jun-15
71667	Tramadol	"I began taking tramadol for very severe cramps during my period, and not only did it make the pain stop, it made me more productive and greatly helped my mood. I&#039;m lucky in that it does not require a prescription where I live so I can buy it from my pharmacist. I take it along with Chinese herbs that really helped save my life ( TCM views depression as being a lack of life force or &#039;jing&#039;) and the combo of he shu wu, schizandra, and tramadol have done wonders for improving my quality of life. Tramadol is however habit inducing and the withdrawal can suck. I get essentially really bad restless leg syndrome when I&#039;ve gone off of it, to the point where I can&#039;t sleep."	13-Apr-17
139274	Phentermine	"I started Adipex in 2006 weighing in at 215lbs and used it for 2 months, got down to 185lbs, which is less 30 lbs. I stopped taking it and gained 15lbs, give or take. I started it again 2 days ago at 196lbs and weighed in today at 189lbs. The positive thing is I crave water, and since I am never hungry I eat healthy because I don&#039;t want to eat anything. "	9-May-08
127531	Phentermine	"I started this on 8/11 at 274.4 lbs (female 5&#039;6&quot;) and today I am down 4 pounds to 270.4lb. The first day I felt like a tweaker, and had nausea in the morning but I realized it was another medicine I take also making me sick, so today I felt fine. I got a normal lunch portion, and 1/4 of the way through I was done. I haven&#039;t thought about food at all. I&#039;ve made a conscious effort to lower my carb intake to try to get the best results. I had already changed my lifestyle before starting this medicine which I feel will continue to give me better results. It will make you very thirsty so plan on spending a lot of time in the bathroom and refilling your water. I will check back in at the end of the month! Super excited for this little boost!"	14-Aug-17
140992	Escitalopram	"I started feeling the calming effects of Lexapro after about three weeks. I&#039;m high-achieving, driven, and I love being productive and challenged. Episodes of depression have made dealing with everyday life somewhat difficult, mostly due to the insomnia that comes with depression/anxiety. I was having difficulty sleeping for about a week when I broke down and spoke with my doctor. I was prescribed Lexapro and my symptoms are almost entirely alleviated. I work midnights so I take Lexapro at around 3:00 PM. The first week I had very bad headaches and felt dizzy. I took 5 mg instead of the 10 mg which decreased the intensity of the headaches, and again, the side effects subsided pretty quickly. In addition to this, I lost eight pounds."	11-Mar-16
140612	Escitalopram	"I was once you, anxiously reading reviews for Lexapro. I began getting severe anxiety and mild depression and my doctor recommended 10mg of Lexapro. I have never liked taking drugs, but I felt like it was my only choice.  The first 2-3 weeks my experience worsened. Every side effect you could have, I had. Drowsiness, sleep problems, nausea, vomiting, decreased libido, constant yawning, the list goes on. However it started to lighten up every week. By Week 6, every side effect was gone.  11 months later and I&#039;m still on 10mg and I can&#039;t explain how much my life has improved over the past year. My life is back. I&#039;m happier than ever and enjoying every aspect of life again. It may be hard at the start, but it&#039;s worth it. I believe in you! peace"	30-Jan-17
127737	Phentermine	"I lost 70 lbs in 6 mos. on Phentermine 37.5 . I had to have surgery and the surgeon required me to come off of it 3 weeks prior to the surgery and 3 weeks post surgery, then I had some complications following my surgery... I gained 23 lbs back which was very disappointing.    I just picked up my new prescription today and can&#039;t wait to get started again! The only side effect I had in the past was the first 3-4 nights I had trouble sleeping.After that no problem!But the main key is drink plenty of water ! It does really work and you are not hungry!"	17-Mar-17
71882	Tramadol	"I was in a car wreck with whiplash. eye sensitivity, pain from mid back of head down spine to below shoulder blades, and out to both shoulders, and involving full lumbar area. Doctors put me on this stuff for the intense pain. I took it for two days, hoping it would help. OMG it double-downed my pain. I wanted to kill anyone and everyone, walls, sheets, everything that got in my way or accidently pissed me off. Called the doctor and literally growled at her about how much I hurt. I expected double pain to some extent after that kind of a shake up but this was beyond acceptable and as soon as it was out of my system I still hurt but was back under 10 on that 1 to 10 scale."	5-Jun-16
128634	Phentermine	"My wife started taking Adipex in December of 2014, she finished it up through April 2015 and went from 187 lbs to 152 lbs.  She kept to the same 1200 calorie diet she has always done for almost two years, and she works out on a variety of fitness classes to running an hour on a treadmill 3-4 times a week.  It is 6/14/15 and I weigh 288 lbs and I am 5&#039;10&quot;. I work out 4-5 times a week doing exercises like basketball twice a week for two hours and running two other times a week and lifting twice a week. So I am at the gym 5-6 times a week.

64505	Sertraline	"Over the last 15 years ive had depression in bouts and accompanied by OCD &amp; anxiety, heightened after the birth of my daughter in 2013. I was convinced she would die, suffered panic attacks, sickness and the lowest low I&#039;ve ever experienced. I wanted to die, convinced that she would be better off without me. Every day was hell. My friends &amp; husband forced me to go to the doctor, who listened to me, diagnosed and prescribed. I&#039;m just finishing month 5 and can honestly say that combined with intensive therapy to help me address what caused the issues I&#039;M HAPPY!!!!!! Its not been easy but stick on it. Yes the nausea at the beginning wasn&#039;t great but it lasted a few weeks. I&#039;m sleeping again, have lost weight and am learning to love me."	31-May-16
71685	Tramadol	"I was prescribed Tramadol in the early treatment of my autoimmune disease when my pain was so intense I was bed ridden. It was a complete joke. It did nothing! Taking 4 Advil gave me more relief than Tramadol (took my pain down from a 10+ to an 8). Luckily, I was switched to a schedule II med and now I am a fully functioning person. I think the drug company needs to do additional HUMAN research on this drug and NOT on mice/animals. In reading the reviews, I see that it does work for some people but for others it&#039;s basically a tic tac with the side effects of addiction."	19-Mar-17
128683	Phentermine	"I started taking phentermine about 5 weeks ago or 6 weeks to be exact I started at 176 and now thank god I&#039;m 152 I have a couple more To go but this really suppresses the appetite."	6-May-15
128602	Phentermine	"I started taking phentermine 37.5 today. I have read a lot of comments here, but I don&#039;t think I have read of anyone else taking topiramine with the phen.  This is my first time on either drug and am pretty impressed so far. I have had little to no appetite today and have had to force myself to eat. I am diabetic, so I am no stranger to carrying a bottle of water. Any suggestions to help me get the most out of phen would be greatly appreciated."	23-May-15
97141	Ambien	"Took my first Ambien last night at 10. Started with half like my doctor said. Took the other half at 1am since first half obviously didn&#039;t work. Here I sit at 5:30am and my eyes still haven&#039;t closed. Only difference with me is that when I didn&#039;t take I sleep a couple of hours and feel fine. Taking Ambien I don&#039;t sleep at all but feel tired!"	27-May-11
63909	Sertraline	"I was skeptical about anti-depressants for a long time and decided to take them only as a last resort. I&#039;ve been on 200mg of Zoloft for about 6 months now and the results are fantastic. I&#039;ve had a tremendous improvement in mood, energy, and all around motivation to get up in the morning. I have also had zero side effects. Unless something changes I will continue to take this medication and recommend it to others as well."	9-Aug-17
96290	Sertraline	"I have been using Zoloft for about 9 years now. I&#039;ve tried most anti-depressants since I was about 21. I&#039;m 37 now.  I wouldn&#039;t recommend Zoloft to those under 25 as it worked better for me in my late 20s.  It doesn&#039;t cause weight gain which is good.  I don&#039;t have much of an appetite so I have small amounts of food which satisfy me.  At the start I got the normal side effects, diarrhea, agitation, sweating, etc. but it tends to get better over the years.  My worst time for depression was a week before my period so I just take a higher dose and it helps me a lot.  A friend of mine has started Pristiq (Desvenlafaxine) and she says its fantastic.  So much more energy which I&#039;m after as Zoloft doesn&#039;t give me much energy at all."	3-Oct-10
141656	Escitalopram	"This medicine is a life saver.  I was diagnosed with anxiety/panic disorder in the spring of 2011, and I was on 30mg for a year.  The only side effect I had was lack of sex drive/ability.  Because of this, I weaned off it, and all of my anxiety and panic attacks came back.  I was miserable for about 2 months until I went back on it.  I&#039;ve tried Zoloft, Remeron, and Wellbutrin, but Lexapro is the only one that worked for me.  I had zero panic attacks on Lexapro and enjoyed life.  I am currently back on 10mg and will be moving up to 20mg shortly.  Everyone&#039;s experience differs with these kinds of medicines, but my advice is: stay on it.  The first few weeks might be rough, but as long as the side effects aren&#039;t terrible, give it time."	11-Aug-12

141026	Escitalopram	"I had suffered with mild depression for quite a few years, The Dr. had prescribed several anti-depressants over the years, with mild effectiveness, so I stopped taking them. When I was in my mid 30&#039;s, I had an episode where I thought I was having a heart attack. After going to the ER, I was diagnosed with having panic disorder. I was totally embarrassed and thought I was being a hypocondriac. These panic attacks continued on and on. I had enough, and told my Dr. about it. She prescribed Lexapro. I reluctantly took it, thinking it would be like the others.I was totally wrong. I finally felt like my true self....not afraid, or anxious and no more panic attacks! I can finally live my life without fear. So thankful for this medication."	25-Nov-15
34252	Tramadol	"I was prescribed this to help with RA and Periphreal Neuropathy in my feet. My script is 50mg, I take one at night. I also take Gabapentin 300mg at night. The pain is much better, but I have horrible hangovers. I don&#039;t know which is the problem, but I don&#039;t want to stop because my pain is tolerable now. "	9-Nov-08
128344	Phentermine	"I have been off of my Vyvanse for 5 months now in a trade with my physician to help lose weight. I started out at 260. Each month my doctor would come up with an excuse to not put me on Phentermine. The other day she mentioned how this could not be taken along side with Vyvanse. I reminded her that I gave that up months ago in order to get something for weight loss. I have back injuries, require right hip replacement and double knee replacement. They said I was not a candidate for any replacements due to my weight, the weight I gained waiting for Phentermine. Now I weigh 319 and can barely get around. Thanks Doc!!! I pray this helps me!"	28-Nov-15
138645	Phentermine	"I started taking Adipex-P on October 21, 2012. My starting weight was 267 and I&#039;m a 5&#039;2&quot; 22 year old female. When I went back to the doctor 6 weeks later I weighed in at 247... so 20 lbs in 6 week. I almost started crying in the doctor&#039;s office. I have never in my life been told that I had lost a good amount of weight (maybe just a pound or two at checkups which probably had mostly to do with clothing or water weight). The second time I went back I weighted in at 231. Totaling 36lbs. All of which I wasn&#039;t exercising. I had dry mouth a lot and no interest in food what so ever. Now on my home scale about a month since weighing in last time I am down to about 225. 42lbs in 21 weeks =)"	15-Mar-12
72535	Tramadol	"I have used Tramadol for about 2 weeks for knee, lower back, leg &amp; foot pain. It has been of slight to moderate help, but nothing to brag about.The main side effects were constipation and dry mouth. I had nausea the first 2 times, but didn&#039;t take with food. Have no nausea or lightheadedness when taken with food since then."	12-Feb-10
72149	Tramadol	"I&#039;ve tried over 13 medications for anxiety and none have worked not even the popular benzodiazepines. I tried 100mg of Tramadol and I felt the weight lifted from me. I felt like I could breath easier and relaxed.  It&#039;s the only thing that has worked. I&#039;m looking for a doctor now who has experience with long term use or perhaps a doctor that can recommend a medication knowing that Tramadol works for me."	14-Feb-15
138855	Phentermine	"I started using phentermine 7/17/10. My starting weight was 235lbs. It took me a year to get to 235 from 248. I find that ridiculous... a year to lose 13 pounds. So as of today (wk 5) I am down to 216lbs. I love having to remind myself to eat instead of eating just because I feel like it or out of boredom. I do cardio for 35 min 5 days/week plus warm up/cool down walk for 10 min. I have a 1300 calorie per day limit but I stay well below due to having no appetite."	25-Aug-10
139271	Phentermine	"I have been taking phentermine for 3 weeks, and have lost 10-15 lbs. It has increased my energy level substantially.  I went off of it for 3 days and saw a little bit of a difference with my appetite and energy, but also had tubal ligation during that period.  I have not noticed any side effect last longer than a few days. Great appetite suppresant."	13-May-08
63835	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been on Sertraline since June and now it&rsquo;s November. So let&rsquo;s call it 5 months.   I started off very small dosages. Eventually increasing all the way to 150mg a day (which I&rsquo;m on now).   I&rsquo;m 34, Male. The side effects make it very very difficult to ejaculate and very, very hard to have a good nights sleep. Both problems are a direct result of the Sertraline.   The positive side - less frightened and less scared. Less anxiety. Less depressed. I actually feel good. I do not think I&rsquo;m &lsquo;high&rsquo; or &lsquo;delusional&rsquo;. I am still 100% my normal self but my fears and worries and low mood seem to have went way down. I actually look forward to waking up now. hope it lasts. Starting these was definitely the right thing to do."	18-Nov-17
64707	Sertraline	"This is my second bout of anxiety and depression in 2 years, 2 years ago I was prescribed citalapram and I dealt with it and finally got myself back on track and ended up stopping the citalapram but sure as anything the depression and anxiety returned this time 2 years later  the doctor prescribed me sertraline 50mg. OMG for any of you that haven&#039;t had depression before don&#039;t accept how this drug makes you feel, I had 1 tablet and I felt so bad - worse than I felt without it. This isn&#039;t normal after going through this before I know how you should feel. I&#039;ve never had a medication so harsh that makes you feel so bad, as I said citalapram is what I took last time and tomorrow I&#039;m back to the doctors to get some cos this stuff is just harsh."	20-Oct-15
71953	Tramadol	"Like many of the reviewers here I discovered the benefits of the medicine for depression by accident. It had been prescribed for back pain after I hurt by back lifting a heavy bag out of the car trunk at the airport. Yes, it helped in a with the back pain from  the injury but it totally destroyed my depression immediately. It works in less than 1 hour and you will feel uplifted and hopeful .If you suffer from depression talk with your Dr.  about Tramadol. Plain and simple...it works and works fast. No kidding this is a depression killer."	26-Jun-15

138700	Phentermine	"Hello this is a follow up, I posted on here on 1-17-12 while I was at a 44 lbs total weight loss. I did stop taking this medication for a month so I could get full effect again. I started back on it about a week ago. I wanted to note that I did not gain anything back on the month I was off of it. And my eating habits were easy to keep. Also as of today I am at 230 lbs. Now at a total weight loss of 53 lbs. Still loving it."	29-Feb-12
64883	Sertraline	"Been taking 25mg zoloft for 2 weeks. Due to non stop over thinking, paranoia and constant checking up on suspected cheating partner. This drug has enabled me to think clearly again and be able to end an unhappy relationship that I could not end before. I don&#039;t react or panic at the thought of being on my own anymore. Its great to feel balanced and even keeled with my thoughts. No real side effects, although I am more motivated at home and don&#039;t seem to have a huge appetite so lost some weight. I like this drug, its given me some sanity again however I am worried about the symptoms returning if I stop taking it."	23-May-15
64732	Sertraline	"I promised myself I&#039;d come back to this site and share my experience since it has helped me so much. About four months ago I had my first panic attack, a week after a very serious surgery, my doctor suggested it was from the anesthesia. Went two weeks without another one, then boom, full blown panic disorder. I thought I was losing my mind, I had to drop out of school and take off work. Went to see a psych who gave me Zoloft, started on 25mg (2weeks) then 50mg where I&#039;m at now. I&#039;ve been at the full dose for 2 months now and I finally feel &quot;that switch&quot; that people talk about go off. The side effects? HORRIBLE. If I didn&#039;t need to stick with it I wouldn&#039;t have. Headaches, insomnia, palpitations, excessive yawning. They go away."	29-Sep-15
127749	Phentermine	"I suffer from obsessive compulsive personality disorder.   It makes me not want to be around other people so I stay in all the time, which leads to extreme lethargy.  I just lay in bed all day and spiral downward until I have no energy to do anything at all.   Fastin gives me the energy psychologically as well as physically to get out of bed and start doing things.  It does cause some side effects, but these are to be expected with something that works so powerfully.  Only this or Zoloft have helped me to lead a productive life.   With doctors for zoloft, I have to make appointments, pay for insurance, a doctor visit,  the prescription, and wait in line at the pharmacy, none of which I can do after I run out of medication.  Thank you Fastin"	19-Feb-17
140803	Escitalopram	"I cannot even begin to explain how much this medicine has helped me with my depression/anxiety! The only thing I regret is being stubborn and not take it 3 years earlier! "	24-Jun-16
141387	Escitalopram	"After trying to deal with my anxiety without taking medication for the past 2 yrs I finally gave in and asked my doctor for a recommendation. She prescribed me Lexapro the 1st 2 days were a little scary (especially after reading the 20 million positive and negative reviews) I felt more anxious and on edge than ever but my search results said that would happen and my doctor had told me I would get worse before I started feeling better so I figured it was normal. After the first 2 days I got the over anxious feeling, so I started focusing on watching out for any other side effects and just getting used to it. The constant yawning the 1st few weeks was just annoying but working out helped a bit. 1 month later and things are going better."	8-Sep-14

64606	Sertraline	"I was prescribed Zoloft for depression anxiety and OCD. I was excited to take it. My parents kept me on the holistic lifestyle growing up so I was ready for something to really work for me. Seeing how severe my depression and anxiety were is in my adulthood I decided to try it. 1st day I thought I knew what I was in for but once I experienced it-  it was strange it&#039;s a very strong drug. felt good initially. It was working and I felt happier like my mind was fixing itself. I noticed how dark of a place I was in. 2nd day I  started feeling the negative side effects like feeling tired and restless at the same time which is an awkward and horrible feeling and my anxiety got worse. Also dizzy and ringing ears. I may go back on it but I&#039;m checking w my dr."	17-Feb-16
128114	Phentermine	"I started taking this medication two weeks ago. I am a single mother so i exercise as much as i can. I also have a office job so i sit more than I am active for my 8 hour or more shift. I can say it has decreased my appetite and I get full much faster when I eat. As to eating smaller portions I also cut off sugar drinks all together. I have my cheat days every now and then but who doesn&#039;t? Over all i have lost 8 lbs in two weeks!!! its more than i would of lost eating a cheese burger without it. So over all I am happy about this product and hope to lose much more and cut that cheat day out once and for all. Its also gave me so much more energy. Good luck on your journey guys:)"	4-Jun-16

64622	Sertraline	"I started off on 50 mg. I was instantly able to tell that my appetite went up. After a week, I went up to 100 mg. I was on 100 mg for 3 weeks and gained four pounds in two weeks. I was eating bigger meals and I craved junk food. However, I felt like it was helping my anxiety a little bit. I decided to stay on it because I have tried Lexapro, Brintellix and Venlafaxine, and none of those worked for me. After the three weeks, I went up to 150 mg. I gained an extra pound, and my anxiety and depression got worse. My sleeping schedule got off, my social as well as general anxiety increased, I was jittery and I wasn&#039;t able to focus on anything."	16-Dec-15
128058	Phentermine	"Been on it week. My ob/gy gave for weight loss. It gives me alot of energy and I don&#039;t eat much like before the pill. I can tell how much I loss now. But I do see the difference in me. It only give dry mouth that all."	30-Jun-16
140910	Escitalopram	"Having great success with escitalopram for anxiety. Have been taking 10 mg daily over 4 weeks now. First AD med I have ever taken and I was quite resistant. But after months of struggling, my life was going downhill quickly. Losing sleep, no appetite, missing work. So glad I got help! Most noticeable start up side effects were some increased anxiety (which thankfully was offset by clonazepam the Dr prescribed), insomnia, complete loss of appetite, and some constipation. These all disappeared in less than 2 weeks and I am now sleeping and eating well with very little anxiety. When I do feel anxious, I can control it instead of it controlling me! I feel my normal self again:)"	6-Jan-16
138564	Phentermine	"Started at 225 now 215 (ten lbs) in 14 days also on a 500 cal diet with little exercise."	10-Apr-13
34140	Tramadol	"I have used Ultram at night along with Xanax. It does allow me more sleep than before. Usually around 4 hours. I do notice a  headache, especially if I take a second dose later at night, I will wake with a headache. I&#039;ve bee taking it for about a year but do not notice any withdrawal if I miss any doses."	12-Jul-09
97153	Ambien	"Worked for sleep but I ran out one time and realized I got very, very depressed on it. Plus had joint and jaw pain all the time. Took 2 years to figure out what caused it."	23-Dec-10
97047	Ambien	"Life time insomnia, 5 mg ambien is good for me.  One half hour before bedtime I take 5 mg, turn off tv, put books aside, computer is off and I am in bed.  Generally wake up 7 hrs later thanking the sleep Gods for a good night!"	25-Oct-13
204091	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve been taking Lexapro for a week now to help me keep mellow like jello. I&#039;m not taking anything else. I work 3rd shift. So my nights are days. And days are nights. This makes makes me extremely sleepy by the end of the week. I have only been on it for a week. This last Friday after I got off work. I fell asleep in recliner from 8:00am to 1:00pm got up ate a bite. Went to bed. I woke up to go to the bathroom a few times. But didn&#039;t get out of bed till 11:00pm Saturday. I have not left my bedroom, or ate anything. I don&#039;t feel like doing anything or going anywhere. I will be calling my doctor Monday and talking to him about how it makes me feel. "	23-Feb-14
71786	Tramadol	"I have severe RLS. I tried requip, mirapex, neurontin, lyrica... Like many others who have posted, I had a pinched nerve in my spine (upper back, near my neck) and was prescribed Tramadol. It greatly improved my RLS !! It truly was a God-send !! I do have to take 100mg three times a day. And, if I take it too late, I do have to wait for an hour or so for the symptoms to finally diminish. Also, I have some daytime sleepiness, sluggishness. And now that my pinched nerve has become inflamed again, I have severe RLS even while taking the Tramadol. I am hoping that after having a spinal injection for inflamation, my symptoms will improve once again. Until then, here I am, up with the rest of you, enduring this aggravating condition."	15-Dec-16
141882	Escitalopram	"It is a LIFE SAVER. Since I started the medication, I never had anxiety again. I can drive whenever I want and I can do things that I would avoid before the medication. I really recommend this medicine. I think that it does a lot of good things. My mom has also had a really good experience with it as well. I am on 10mg and I haven&#039;t had to change yet. I am also prescribed Xanax for the anxiety, but I never take it because the anxiety seems to have disappeared. I gave the medicine a 9 because I have NO sex drive since I started taking Lexapro. I don&#039;t like it, but I&#039;ll take no sex drive over being miserable. Good luck!"	2-Jun-10
71780	Tramadol	"Stay away from this drug. Few Doctors know how intense it is and what its effects are.  I was precribed much &quot;stronger&quot; opiates before and after, up to oxycodone. Tramadol blew them out of the water.     I have (had as of 1month ago) been on tramadol for 7 years.  I have 2 pars fractures in my low back and this was what I relied on to alleviate any pain. I started with a single 50mg/daily and gradually worked up to 400/mg. I never abused the drug, I simply did what the doctor told me to do.     The level of addiction and dependence to this drug is insane. The withdrawal is the worst thing I have ever experienced. Because of that and its negative effects on my life, relationships, work and happiness, I checked into a detox program and am done."	22-Dec-16
139017	Phentermine	"This did not work at all for me.  I had no side effects and but didn&#039;t lose any weight."	26-Jun-09
64884	Sertraline	"I started on 50mg. I felt better in 2-3 weeks. I was so happy to not be crying. I get dizziness and have the yawning effect. At first it seemed like I would yawn every 2 minutes for days. The only thing that upset me about it was that I gained weight. I&#039;m already a bit on the heavy side, but I had been maintaining my weight for years. All of a sudden I gained about 25 lbs in 6 months. When I talked to my Dr, he said the dosage wasn&#039;t high enough, that I was emotionally eating. It didn&#039;t make sense to me, since I had been able to maintain my weight even during my depression. Anyway, he upped it to 100mg. Now, I just feel lazy. I don&#039;t care about getting things done. I have to really make an effort to do anything. I&#039;m going back to 50mg."	22-May-15
96611	Sertraline	"It works very well at first but I seem to have gotten used to it very fast. After about 3 months I&#039;m already on the max dose of 300mg."	13-Aug-08
72187	Tramadol	"My shrink put me on this in 2010. I was overdue for a hip replacement, and it showed when I hobbled into his office! Combined with ketoprofen 75 mg (best NSAID out there for pain) 100 mgs twice daily got me through for 5 months till surgery. Excellent synergistic effect. Still take it with the NSAID since my spine is arthritic, and my knee is ready for replacement now. Problem is my family doc no longer prescribes NSAIDs because of heart and kidney concerns! He thinks 3 tramadol daily is sufficient! "	20-Jun-14
96285	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been on Zoloft for 12 months. I&#039;ve had social anxiety since I was 13 (I&#039;m 22) but a year ago I had a traumatic experience and constantly felt like my stomach was in knots. After 3 months of feeling that way, I went to a doctor and was prescribed 25 mg Zoloft. The initial side effects were being incredibly tired (it was hard to stay awake just driving to class), dry mouth and anxiety for a short time. Eventually I was at 100mg/day and had lost about 12 lbs. I am on 75mg now, have been for about 9 months and have gained most of the weight back. Side-effects now are absolutely no sex drive and if I forget to take it I have &quot;brain shivers&quot;. I definitely would recommend to anyone. I finally can talk to people without feeling my heart beat out of my chest."	14-Oct-10
140549	Escitalopram	"I was prescribed lexapro about a year after my assault. I took only one pill. It made me feel worse than the anxiety it self. I was in a daze all day not sure how I made to college that day and back home. Walking was like I was drunk and the overall feeling inside me was horrible. what a waste of $65.00 back then."	10-Mar-17
140678	Escitalopram	"Just got put back on lexapro 20mg a few days ago after being off of it for a few months. Same side effects as when I had started it before; a headache that doesn&#039;t wanna go away, nausea, lightheadedness, dizziness and my insomnia has gotten worse."	22-Sep-16
138889	Phentermine	"Adipex is a very strong weight loss aid. An ex of mine took it with great results. Although if not taken as prescribed (late in the day), you will not sleep. It curbs your appetite sometimes she didn&#039;t even eat. As any medicine, it will affect each person differently."	16-Jan-10
214657	Escitalopram	"Have been taking for over 10 years mixed in with a period of about 2 years when my doctor took me off because of depression symptoms subsiding. The majority of the time I have been on 10mg, last 2 years have had dose raised to 20mg. The drug has worked great for me. Terrific improvement from when I started and 99% reduction in panic attacks. Reduction in OCD symptoms as well. Well tolerated for me at least, but I realize with these medications everyone is different. It&rsquo;s not perfect but the relief I got was real and changed my life. For that I am thankful."	8-Sep-17
139057	Phentermine	"I started the medication on 5/28/09 and its now June 9th.  I have lost 6 lbs in eleven days. I am happy with the medication and it definitely helps with the appetite. However, you do have to exercise and watch what you eat. I don&#039;t have those sweet cravings now. I have had little to know side effects. I really haven&#039;t noticed having extra energy but do have dry mouth.  I chew sugarless gum and drink plenty of water."	9-Jun-09
95876	Sertraline	"I have suffered from SEVERE PMS for years. I am a very positive upbeat person. I hate the fact that my PMS caused me such stress. I couldn&#039;t think clearly, would fly off the handle and nothing. My husband and children felt the effects of it each month. I just wanted to run far far away and jump out of my skin. I couldn&#039;t handle it anymore. After explaining this to my PCP, she thought Zoloft would help me. Advised me to take 25 mg for 7 days, then increase to 50mg. I&#039;m not kidding you, after 2 days I saw a huge change. I finally had energy! It has been 2 months now and I never increased to 50mg. The 25mg did the trick! I no longer have PMS. I think clearer than I have in years. My mind doesn&#039;t race. I&#039;m calm and I have my life back. Thank God!"	7-Jun-14
96443	Sertraline	"After 4 different medications, Zoloft has worked the best for me personally."	20-Jun-09
34228	Tramadol	"I got put on tramadol today for pain in my back after falling on the ice and hitting the cement stairs in front of my house. About ten minutes after I took it my back felt a lot better. I was not sleepy and I am able to function and get things done while taking this medication. It helps tremendously and I strongly recommend it to anyone who has to take care of children. This works because you don&#039;t feel &quot;out of it&quot;."	27-Jan-09
96014	Sertraline	"I have been on sertraline for 2 weeks now for anxiety/depression. It&#039;s certainly helped with anxiety, it stops that horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach. I do feel much more optimistic but I&#039;m not out of the woods yet. I am hoping that after 4weeks of taking it (50mg once day) that things will settle even more. I struggle with over thinking/analyzing, letting my internal bully take over and being totally irrational. All of this causes severe anxiety and I lost a stone in 10 days. I&#039;m having CBT as well which brings up a lot of raw emotion but I think (hope!) the combination of both will steer me through this."	8-Nov-12
95827	Sertraline	"I had my first panic attack in June 2013. Thought I was going to die. Had them everyday after that. I couldn&#039;t go no where or do anything because I was so dizzy and scared. I went from June to Sept with no medicines. I was suicidal so I tried meds, First two days I was a zombie, no appetite. I felt weird but not like panic attack weird. I could tell a difference. I have been on my Zoloft 25ml since Sept 2013 and I am 97% better. I have my days where I feel weird but if you have severe panic attacks like I did you will know that even feeling 5% better would be nice so 97% is amazing! This medicine saved my life."	30-Mar-14
34118	Tramadol	"This medication did nothing for my pain. Had to stop taking Ultram after 5 days due to extreme agitation."	24-Aug-09
138588	Phentermine	"I been on this pill for a week today and have lost 5 pounds. I think is great I just want time to go faster. 45lbs more to go."	12-Feb-13
96322	Sertraline	"I started using this about 5 weeks ago.  I noticed the difference in the way I felt within a day or two.  I was able to focus and concentrate again!  I&#039;ve gotten even better as the weeks have gone by.  I was still feeling very tired after three weeks so my Doctor added Wellbutrin with the Zoloft and now I feel great!  Zoloft works...in some cases you may need an additional medicine, not always."	27-May-10
64581	Sertraline	"I was having suicidal thoughts really bad before taking sertraline.  I also used to run off from my friend  at Macy&#039;s while shopping with her and one minute I would be standing next to her and next minute I was gone and I kept running off from my mom and my friend Tina and I confessed  to my mom that I have a problem and that I need to do something about it and my mom took me to the doctor and I told my doctor I think I am depressed and he put me on sertraline 25 mg once a day and I found out I was depressed and had severe major depression. Things are a lot better now since I&#039;ve been on sertraline for a long time."	24-Jan-16
63919	Sertraline	"I used to be against medication but when my anxiety and depression began to feel uncontrollable, I decided maybe it was time to seek help. I started zoloft about a week ago, and I feel the need to really tell you guys so far on how I feel. I am less moodier. My husband had noticed a huge change in me. I used to always be in this bad mood and my anxiety used to get the best of me by running my whole day. I am so much more in control of me emotions. My husband isn&#039;t too fond of me being on this, however, my kids seem to be a lot more happier (even him) when I am more peaceful."	23-Jul-17
64664	Sertraline	"This medication is wonderful. I used to call it my happiness pill. I was deep on a major depressive episode. I couldn&#039;t get off bed, crying all the time, no energy or even willing to go on.  I must admit first days on this medication were really bad. I wanted to quit it. I had like jaw tremors and continuous yawning and my face made weird expressions on the first few days. But after that was just awesome. I felt happy all the time no matter what. I lost 30 pounds like in 6 months. So I felt amazing.The  bad part was  I couldn&#039;t have an orgasm. and libido was down because of that. I got changed to wellbutrin but miss sertraline so much."	9-Nov-15
128092	Phentermine	"Made me super sick. This was my first time trying it, I took the prescribed dose, and I&#039;ve been trembling out of my skin for the last hour. My blood pressure is through the roof and my heart rate is 141 bpm right now. I&#039;m also nauseous and would be at the emergency room right now if not so terrified I&#039;d crash my car if I tried to drive."	12-Jul-16

127621	Phentermine	"I&#039;ve been on adipex for 11 months now and I&#039;ve dropped 117 pounds! I didn&#039;t exercise only took the pill and cut out everything bad (even though it taste good, doesn&#039;t always make it healthy for you) eating wise. Sugar, flour, bread, pastas, FASTFOOD, and even eating after a certain time. I started eating healthy snacks every two hours, ( egg whites, cottage cheese, bag of steamers vegetables, lots of chicken, belvita snacks, carrots and peanut butter etc,and drinking lots of water! Do this and I promise you&#039;ll drop weight immediately."	11-May-17
64733	Sertraline	"I started taking zoloft the other day. I only took 2 days worth and at first I just felt out of it and I heard that was common but then I started having even worse panic attacks and trouble sleeping. In the middle of the night the second night I starting having mild hallucinations. Things were moving and just looking weird and I had to wakeup my fianc"	28-Sep-15
71877	Tramadol	"Have Ledderhose syndrome for 12 years now. Had four growths removed and am on number 5 and 6 now. this is better the zapain. less side effects plus always a good up feeling. been on it 2 years after zapain for 8 years. I do live in the UK so have National health service . But I work 40 hours  a week in a casino. I had to change jobs from pitboss/ inspector to cashier  so I can sit down. Always cycled to work but have recently developed issues with my hip and back. So stay as active as possible. and good luck people"	12-Jun-16
71751	Tramadol	"I broke my nose and was prescribed tramadol by the dr after whatever shot the gave me in the hospital did not take away the pain. Took 2 and the pain went away. It worked great for me and made me feel really good and drowzy. This definitely worked for me and I was able to sleep at night. Was able to go off it no problem and weened myself down by not taking it so often"	4-Nov-16
97114	Ambien	"Good for four hours and then I was wide awake and needed another dose to get back to sleep.  Good if your only problem is getting to sleep."	26-Nov-11
71649	Tramadol	"I was put on Tramadol for pain and a funny thing happened.   I noticed I felt more energy and overall well being.   I had felt a bit depressed over the years and they tried a few meds but none seemed to work.   I had surgery and was given tramadol.   Once the pain was gone - I stopped it and noticed I fell back into my old slump.   I was in therapy and tried everything.  Years later  I went to Mexico for business and saw Tramdol in the pharmacy.  I bought one bottle of 50mg capsules and said let&#039;s try this. 50mg twice a day.  Within 2 weeks people were commenting I seemed like I was happier.   It does not give me a high like hydrocodone and other opiate meds.   They need to explore this and stop shooting it down as an antidepressant."	29-Aug-17
96068	Sertraline	"I am a 30 yr old female who has suffered from severe panic attacks since I was 16 yrs old. I lost my mother of a fatal heart attack when she was 27 yrs old and have always feared the same would happen to me. I have seen a cardiologist since I was 17 and have had as many heart tests done that they would probably perform on an 80 yr old. I&#039;ve always checked out fine and not seemed to have inherited anything my mother had. When I have anxiety, which leads into a panic attack my mind spirals out of control. I am a nurse also and picture worse case scenarios all these symptoms could be. I have been on Zoloft for 6 weeks now. It&#039;s helping but I&#039;m still not 100% and using Xanax to cope. I&#039;m pleased with results though and hopeful I will get better."	21-Jul-12
140571	Escitalopram	"I was taking Xanax..0.25 mgs three times everyday for over 13 years. My Dr wanted me to wean off of it so to help thru the process she had me take 5mgs per day of Lexapro (escitolopram).  I kept taking the Lexapro for 1-1/2 years. During this time my Dr raised the dosage to 10 mgs daily. Lexapro wasn&#039;t the medicine for me. It caused more anxiety, mood swings and weight gain along with not feeling like myself. With the help of my Dr I weaned off Lexapro over a period of 3 weeks. After the 2nd day of not taking Lexapro I started with constant brain zaps, fatigue, dizziness with vertigo and felt overall awful. This continued for the next 7 weeks but the withdrawal symptoms lessened each week. I am now at the 8th week and feel wonderful!"	1-Dec-16

96548	Sertraline	"I HAVE DONE EXTREMELY WELL ON THIS MEDICATION, i HAVE NOT HAD A SINGLE PANIC ATTACK SINCE i STARTED TAKING IT, MY DEPRESSION IS BETTER i WOULDN&#039;T SAY IT&#039;S COMPLETELY GONE. THE TWO NEGATIVES ARE LOWER SEX DRIVE WHICH DOESN&#039;T BOTHER ME, AND WEIGHT GAIN WHICH DOES BOTHER ME ALOT! BUT i HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN, BEING OVERWEIGHT OR NOT LOSING MY MIND ANY MOMENT, i CHOSE THE LATTER!"	17-Mar-08
64123	Sertraline	"I have had what I see as pretty bad social anxiety, to the point where I look back and realize how much life I have missed out on. It took me a while to actually become aware of it, but for some time now I have been dwelling on it since it makes it super hard to make friends. So, I usually see myself as not having very effective medications (such as SSRIs) for depression/anxiety etc. Either that, or it&#039;s hard to notice improvement. I specifically wanted to go on a medication for my social anxiety so my doctor ended up putting me on zoloft and I love it...I can actually see improvement and I have even made a friend. It&#039;s to the point where I feel like I can notice myself being more anxious when I forget to take it at the beginning of the day"	17-Apr-17
128836	Phentermine	"UPDATE~ started taking phentermine on 7/18/14 and as of today 9/15/14 I&#039;m down 32 lbs in almost 2 months. Still have dry mouth but not as bad. Drinking 65 to 70 ounces of water a day along with a 1,800 calorie diet. No sugar no soda no fast food. Everything fresh and baked not fried.mire updates next month."	15-Sep-14
64482	Sertraline	"I suffered from severe postpartum depression, anxiety, and OCD. More so horrifying intrusive thoughts that consumed my life, I literally wanted to give up. I was too scared to try a medication. I suffered from the time my baby was 6 months old to 18 months old. Finally I decided that Zoloft was my last hope. I started off at a low dose of 25mg and gradually increased it to 50, and finally 100mg. I can say I feel amazing. I don&#039;t ruminate on my obsessive thoughts anymore. Yes sometimes the thoughts still come into my head, but I am able to notice them as being an anxious thought and I don&#039;t spend hours days or months obsessing on them. They literally come in and go out, and I can function! I love zoloft! It saved my life!"	16-Jul-16
128892	Phentermine	"I took phentermine for 9 months losing close to 70 pounds (start weight 200 end weight 130) I was so happy with the results but.... As soon as I stopped taking it I gained all the weight back plus 10 pounds. My doctor prescribed it for me again but my body no longer responded to the medicine. That was my experience. I don&#039;t regret trying it."	12-Jun-14
128518	Phentermine	"This is my 3rd day on Phentermine 37.5. I take a half pill in the morning before breakfast and then the other half b/w 1&amp;2. I have still experienced hunger around 12 as if I haven&#039;t ate anything at all. But when I do eat something I am full pretty quickly. My starting weight is 270. I am 5&#039;7 and 22 year old female. I will only be on this for 2 months so I&#039;m hoping for good results along with exercise and healthy eating"	31-Jul-15

140544	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve been taking lexapro 10mg since Jan. It has helped with my depression. But I started feeling down an anxious. So I asked for my dose to go up. I&#039;m now on 20mg. I can feel the difference. I do take clonazepam for when feel my anxiety kicks in. However I&#039;ve come down feeling very sick since starting the 20mg like I did when I started the 10mg. Not a very great side affect. I also get very sleepy so I do have to take it at bedtime. Dreams seem very real. Scary real. Hopefully I don&#039;t have to be on very long when my vitamin d goes up to its normal levels."	18-Mar-17
64454	Sertraline	"After breaking up with my high school sweetheart, I would have panic attacks that would violently wake me up at night.  I knew I had a problem but it wasn&#039;t depression (later I realized anxiety) since I was happy to start over in college.  My stress of attending school even as a commuter laid heavy on my mind as well.  I went to my doctor, crying that I did not know what was wrong.  After 3 years, I still remain on Zoloft/Sertraline at 25mg.  I&#039;ve always been told it&#039;s not a lot but it still really helps me.  I rarely get panic attacks anymore, and if I do, I don&#039;t throw up or feel dizzy.  I am happy that I haven&#039;t had any side effects or problems involving this medication."	28-Apr-16

34178	Tramadol	"Ultram was helpful for my muscle pain associated with the fibromyalgia. It did not make me feel &#039;dopey&#039; or &#039;high&#039; or more tired, etc. However, I would have to eat a substantial meal before taking it and then eat an apple or something after I took it or I feel on the verge on vomiting.  It made me so nauseated if my stomach was not completely full."	4-May-09
140463	Escitalopram	"Blood sugar has gone through the roof. From normal range (for me, about 100 pre-meal to 140ish 2 hours after a meal) to steadily around 300.  Some weight gain.  Mood is improved quite a bit, so high marks for that.  Sexual side effects are extremely frustrating. Everyone says they will diminish in time, but it&#039;s been 6 months. Not a problem with ED or stamina, but getting to orgasm has proven elusive.   The blood sugar is the major concern, so if my doctor can help me get that under control I may continue. Otherwise I&#039;ll talk with my psychiatrist about dumping it."	23-May-17
96439	Sertraline	"Zoloft is great it really has helped me with depression and anxiety. I have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and getting depressed and upset triggered severe asthma attacks. I take 100mgs twice a day. It has really been a blessing. Don&#039;t listen to any of us, every person is different try it and see what it does for you, then you and your Doctor can decide the proper treatment for you. "	6-Jul-09
63945	Sertraline	"Hi Guys, I was prescribed sertraline 3 weeks ago as I was suffering from frequent panic attacks, we have no idea how these attacks started as I&#039;m a fit healthy 19 year old male, I&#039;m also type 1 diabetic, I&#039;ve had attacks on and off for the past two months now for no apparent reason and these attacks are really bad guys, I&#039;m talking my heart is racing, sweats, dizziness, shaking and lately I&#039;m getting episodes of a crazy burning/tingling sensation throughout my chest and into both arms that lasts about a minute max at a time, I&#039;ve had all my ECG and blood tests done and they seem to be fine, the only thing that&#039;s high is my blood pressure, just wondering if anyone else has experienced this burning/tingling sensation?? is it anxiety??"	26-May-17
96800	Ambien	"I&#039;m 23 got I just got presrecribed 10 mg ambien for sleep . is was probably the best sleeping thing for meds I&#039;ve had for insomnia. I&#039;ve never had any weird experience or others problems either. Even though I&#039;ve been on it for 6 months now."	5-Mar-17
138974	Phentermine	"I started using phentermine a few months back and it has been great for me.  I have lost 26 pounds so far!"	6-Oct-09
64106	Sertraline	"I have been on zoloft 50 mg for over 15 years . Two months ago I brilliantly decided to wean off by taking half pill every other day till done. About two months have gone by and I had to go to Dr&#039;s and get back on  50 mg daily.I started on 25 mg for one week then up to 50mg daily. This is the second day back on it so a total of 50 mg. Today has been horrible I had to leave work. My legs are weak I&#039;m panicky mouth dry as hell zero appetite. I NEVER should have stopped I just don&#039;t remember feeling like this when I first started all those years ago. I just want to get right and stay right !!!! good luck to all"	29-Apr-17
97008	Ambien	"I have never experienced any hallucinogenic side effects from this drug, but I admit I&#039;ve developed a nasty dependency to 100 mgs/night. It is the only sleep aid that doesn&#039;t give me cotton mouth or drowsiness the next day and works like a charm every single time.  Nothing even comes close to its effectiveness. Note:  It IS imperative that you take it at once you are in bed and ready to sleep.  After that you aren&#039;t going anywhere, no sleep walking, driving or binge eating."	23-Mar-15
96035	Sertraline	"I can remember being on this for just two months last year.  What did improve while I was taking it was my concentration--I started reading every book in sight.  I stopped taking the Zoloft because I thought it made me sick to my stomach and also gave me tics.  I guess I should have waited out the side effects because I thought my ability to read was fantastic."	30-Jan-13
95879	Sertraline	"I love sertraline, I can honestly say this medicine has given me my life back after crippling anxiety and depression. I feel back to my old self and able to get on with life"	27-May-14
34245	Tramadol	"I had spinal fusion in lower lumbar region 9 years ago.  I was fine until August &#039;08.  I had such severe sciatic pain doctor progressively put me on Ultram ER 200mg 1x / day.  It worked great.  Pain went away after 4 months.  I stopped taking Ultram and now I am dealing with withdrawal symptoms.  PAY ATTENTION to warnings about long term usage."	6-Dec-08
127752	Phentermine	"At age 54,  taking this is the only way I&#039;ve been able to lose weight. I used to be able to lose 10 to 20 pounds pretty easily with just better food choices and mild exercise. But over the last  several years with a strict Paleo diet and exercising five days a week, three days a week with a trainer, I Wasn&#039;t able to drop a single pound.  As you get older you must consume a depressingly small amount of food in order to lose weight, this drug gives you the willpower to stay with a low cal a day diet.  For me it&#039;s impossible to shop and cook and only consume my low cal per day. So, I used prepared food services like  eat fit go and factor 75 to be certain of the calories I&#039;m consuming with no leftovers and no snacking during cooking."	16-Feb-17
141921	Escitalopram	"I have been taking Lexapro for more than four years at 10mg-20mg.  It has been great at reducing mood swings, anxiety, and sadness. I have not noticed reduced effectiveness, however, my doc did move me up to 20mg because I was still experiencing pms mood swings and irritability.  I also have mild to severe depression.  There are only 3 side effects I have experienced and that is reduced libido, yawning, and inorgasmia. Which I feel I can handle as long as I&#039;m happy and positive. I had tried Zoloft before and it didn&#039;t make me happier it just made me jittery and jumpy all the time and I couldn&#039;t relax.  So, Lexapro has definitely been the answer for me."	1-Feb-10
64598	Sertraline	"Hi everyone. I am recently a new user of zoloft. I am in the process of weaning off the current antidepressant pristiq, which I feel has been not helping me...so my therapist recommended zoloft. She had me start by weaning off pristiq by taking my full dosage and half dosage of zoloft and by week 4 I&#039;ll be completely off pristiq and on zoloft. I&#039;m curious how everyone feels about zolof...their side affects, improvements etc. I suffer from anxiety attacks and slight depression."	22-Feb-16
96061	Sertraline	"Sertraline my experience well...it is amazing! Not going to lie it is hard work to go onto sertraline as it comes with bad side effects e.g headaches, insomnia sleeping to much, dry mouth, mouth ache, having the urge to shake my legs etc. but when it is fully in your system they go so hang in there! But I&#039;d rather be happy and put up with it. I have tried a lot of other medicines for my anxiety depression/panic attacks, which all left me with suicidal thoughts and actually made me feel worse but sertraline gives you strength and confidence and for the first time my happiness feels natural. My friend is also on it for anxiety and it has worked wonders for her."	17-Aug-12
64298	Sertraline	"July 2016 was when I was diagnosed by my psychiatrist with anxiety and depression. So my psychiatrist prescribed me first with sertraline and clonazepam. But after a few weeks I quit using clonazepam but continued taking sertraline. Since the start of the year I was different, I was always serious, I&#039;m always frowning, I rarely talk not like the previous years in which I was obnoxious and energetic. But after a month of taking sertraline, it seems like I came back to that obnoxious me although I still have recurring episodes of depression, apathy and suicidal attempts. The depression was partly gone, my behavior somehow changed but unfortunately anxiety was still there actually never got any better. But I must say sertraline is effective."	2-Oct-16
139043	Phentermine	"I took Adipex 2 years ago. I lost 15 pounds then gained it back plus some over this time. Now I am trying the phentermine 30 mg. I&#039;m on my 4th day plus I am taking chromium too. I have lost 5 pounds. The doctor told me to take 2 a day. I was skeptical. Don&#039;t really like taking 2 so I&#039;m going to cut back to one a day. Have to make myself eat. I have cut out caffeine and sweets. I am not a healthy eater so my main goal is portion control and not eating late at night which is a habit. I don&#039;t really like the side effects but when I took Adipex I was fine after the first week so I hope this is the same."	24-Apr-09
64862	Sertraline	"I am a 29 year old female and I have never taken a drug in my life prior to being prescribed 25mg of Sertraline (Zoloft). I was diagnosed with anxiety and panic attack. One of my panic attacks happened while I was driving to work and I was just scared to death to drive ever since for almost 6 months. I did a lot of research prior to making this drug. I was horrified of side affects and getting addicted to the drug.  Long story short, I have been on this medicine for two months now and it has completely changed my life. I can drive now without fear and I feel great again :). This drug has completely changed my life.   You do not have to be on it forever. Please, talk to your doctor and give this medicine a try.  Take care!"	29-Apr-15
72019	Tramadol	"After a 3-month heavy regimen of surgeon-prescribed oxycodone due to a head-on collision, the oxy was replaced with generic tramadol 50 mg, 1-2 tablets every 4-6 hours. At first I hated it, the numerous side effects caused more suffering than my injuries. I later saw a pain-management specialist who lowered the dosage considerably for my 90-lb frame to 25 mg every 8 hrs and I&#039;ve had much improvement. My pain is more tolerable, I have no more side effects, nor do I need to sign a waiver to obtain it. Most importantly, I can now  function more normally and even drive short distances again. In my case, the correct dosage is the key to success."	4-Aug-16
128246	Phentermine	"I just started on this diet with phentermine and I&#039;m 5&#039;2 weighing 174. I have been on it for 3 days and already lost 3 pounds! I&#039;m excited about the future outcome."	13-Feb-16
140506	Escitalopram	"I feel as if half the time the medicine works really well and then other times that I need a stronger dose to mellow me out. I am currently on 10 mg of escitalopram. I am experiencing bleeding and it is not time for my period so this concerns me. I have been taking this medication for around 4 months now and this side effect just started last week and has continued for close to a week now.its just really strange. Has anyone else experienced bleeding?"	5-Nov-16
138824	Phentermine	"I first took Adipex in July of 2010 for 30 days. I cut out everything white out of my diet. Drank plenty water and lost approximately 13lbs without exercise. I chose not to continue taking the medication and started an exercise regimen where I lost an additional 7lbs. Found myself at a plateau and felt like I wasn&#039;t losing anymore. December 13, 2010 started taking the medication again while continuing exercise regimen and now have lost a total of 28lbs. Made a lifestyle change with proper eating, no fried foods, grilled chicken, fish, beef, lots of veggies, yogurt, fruit and plenty of water. I feel wonderful. Started out in a size 22w and as of Jan. 10, 2011 was able to get into a size 16. WHOHOOOOOO! Macy&#039;s size 12-14 here I come!"	16-Jan-11
128038	Phentermine	"Hello everyone, I am going to review this medication from 6 years ago because it was the first &amp; only time I had taken it &amp; just got prescribed again today. I had blown out my right knee in 2010 bad enough to be out of work for 7 months working as a corrections officer. I weighed in pre op at 363. I am 6&#039;4&quot; tall &amp; in 4 months I lost 70+ lbs. went from 363 to 286lbs from Nov. 2010 to March 2010. In that time I injured my back had to dart pain meds &amp; the pain was so bad that I could no longer exercise. All I did was go to work &amp; come home &amp; lay In bed. From 2010 to today I now weigh 449. After a long battle of immobility &amp; depression along with pain meds, I have now made my mind up to grit my teeth and make another change. This med works."	2-Aug-16
138765	Phentermine	"I have tried all the fad diets to no avail.  I&#039;ve tried over the counter weight loss pills and nothing has worked since stacker 3 original formula was banned.  I was told I would only get Adipex for 3 months.  My third check up is tomorrow and I&#039;ve lost 50lbs so far.  The pill is starting to feel like it&#039;s losing it&#039;s effectiveness.  Tomorrow I am going to start a 10 day break in hopes that when I start back up it will be as effective as the first month.  I&#039;ve got another 40 to go, so hopefully it works.  It&#039;s been great, though.  50 lbs in 2 months when nothing else helped before is very impressive.  It&#039;s nice hearing all the compliments on the weight loss too."	4-Oct-12
96004	Sertraline	"After being diagnosed with PMS my doctor prescribed Sertraline on a cyclical basis. I take the tablets two weeks before my period and I can honestly say they have saved my life. I remember being so shocked when my period started for the first time on them because I hadn&#039;t had any of that awful build up of anger, depression and frustration. It was like a lead weight had lifted off my shoulders. I felt normal again."	17-Feb-13
128577	Phentermine	"I take 15mg phent. daily after breakfast, plus 25mg tenuate (3x day).  Started 6 wks ago, lost 12 lbs in first 2 wks, my diet mostly veggies /chicken, some berries or watermelon for snacking.  I walked for 15-20 min/ day.  It diminished my appetite, easy to avoid sweets.  Lost only 2lbs following 2 wks, and remained the same the following 2 wks.  It affected my already poor sleep, &amp; having more severe headaches, dry mouth &amp; light sensitivity. I&#039;m more tired, constant ringing in ears now; should I stop Tenuate &amp; double dose of Fentermine only? Where&#039;s energy I should have? My Fibro knots in back/shoulders came back; discouraged.   Need to get back with Doc for advice to continue weight loss."	6-Jun-15

141860	Escitalopram	"I&#039;m a 19 year old girl and I&#039;ve been suffering from major depression and social anxiety for the past 5 years. I finally went to the doctors and was prescribed Lexapro 10mg. I&#039;ve been on it for 4 days now. I had side effects the first day I took it - nausea, slight headache, slight dizziness, sleepy and yawning a lot and most annoyingly INSOMNIA! I even felt a little confused at bedtime while trying to sleep. The side effects lasted for the first 3 days, now they&#039;re slowly going away. The first day I was really hyper and the next I was so tired but now it&#039;s starting to balance out and I can sleep better. I haven&#039;t had a depressing day since I&#039;ve been taking Lexapro so lets hope it stays that way."	20-Aug-10
142005	Escitalopram	"Great medication to relieve anxiety. Sex drive went down first two weeks. Go a bit worried, but body adjusted. Occasional dream of gruesome things. Usually what I see on the news or discuss with family. Can&#039;t tell whether or not it&#039;s due to Lexapro."	13-May-09
96844	Ambien	"I take  10mg ambien, 3mg klonipin and 100mg of Seroquel.  Sleep pretty good most of the time.  A bit groggy in the morning but nothing a shot of coffee won&#039;t fix"	11-Apr-17
96086	Sertraline	"I&#039;m a 39 y.o. male who had a job for 8 years that had it&#039;s ups and downs but pretty low with stress levels. I quit and got a new job for the new challenges and higher pay. With that, came more stress than I bargained for along with the stress of the rather long commute in horrible traffic. Long story short, I&#039;m on Zoloft now for a week and most of the symptoms have gone. I&#039;m feeling far more emotionally leveled and my thoughts are far more clear. I don&#039;t feel like a zombie either. I&#039;m feeling less affected by life or issues. It will be interesting to see how I feel in about a month when it&#039;s fully working. So far, so good."	15-May-12
141035	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve been on Escitalopram for 4 weeks. I must say the first week I yawned all the time and had increased anxiety. But I kept taking the 10 mg that was prescribed to me and I feel wonderful. I have zero anxiety and it makes me feel so good. I am able to enjoy life the way I should. Stick it out for the first few weeks even if you feel worse because it does get better. I am so glad I found something that makes me feel real again!"	17-Nov-15
63865	Sertraline	"My story is a positive one and meant to give others hope that they can reclaim their lives and live a normal, happy, healthy one! Dec,2016 I became sick, overloaded, crying constantly &amp; fearful. Dr. gave me Zoloft &amp; Xanax, was terrified to take either, but started xanax once a day at .12mg and it eased anxiety soon went to .25 2x a day. Finally took Zoloft 25mg. Side effects were horrible! Upped to 37.5 after 2 months,2 months later 50.Wish I had listened and taken 50 mg First. My family forced me to stick with it, tho side effects were unbearable.Then One day ,4 weeks into the 50mg dose I felt like my old self. I was excited about life! Happy again. After a week I quit Xanax. I&#039;m Working again &amp;l oving life! Seek therapy! You can do it!"	22-Aug-17
64161	Sertraline	"Half the reviews on here are a load of garbage. They range from &quot;the side effects are too awful&quot; to &quot;It gives me more anxiety&quot;. Do yourself a favor and do not read to any review from anyone who has taken this drug for less than 8 weeks. If you are serious about reducing your anxiety, then grow some balls and give zoloft time to work.     Yes, you&#039;re going to have a number of side effects in the beginning, ranging from drowsiness, nausea, sexual disfunction, loss of appetite, and even increased anxiety. Guess what, nearly all of these are going to disappear after the first two weeks. In fact, all of the side effects disappeared for me, and it wasn&#039;t until around week 8 that I felt the glorious power of this drug.     GIVE IT TIME"	12-Jan-17
34378	Tramadol	"I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis, so am in fairly constant pain.  Ultram has really been a lifesaver, allowing me to work and play.  Headache is sometimes a problem, but I think almost always in combination with caffiene."	27-Mar-08
141108	Escitalopram	"I just started this medicine 3 days ago and I cannot express how much of an effect it has had on me already. I just graduated high school and became depressed soon after, severe anxiety where I couldn&#039;t go out to eat without having to vomit. I also couldn&#039;t keep focus on anything, especially when trying to talk to people, and overall was in the worst state of my life. Thought I was hopefully, constantly having break downs etc. the doctor prescribed this medicine to me a few months before graduation due to anxiety and overall not feeling myself, I was definitely skeptical and taking medicine in my eyes was a sign of weakness so, I put off the treatment hoping I could cure myself out of this funk. I went to ctb and it helped but it was mainly focused on anxiety. I stopped going because it seemed a waste of my time. Graduation rolls around, my best friends leaves for college really early and my life falls apart. A week was about all I could take of the constant emptiness, headaches and nauseous I got from being so depressed so I decided to start lexapro. The doctor prescribed me 10 mg and the first day I took it (in the morning) I was in a state of euphoria. Just a little background on myself, I was never that outgoing but constantly happy. Never the one to be outgoing in front of strangers and was very conscious of people around me. Not on this pill. I was loopy, could not stop laughing and would not shut up. Although this was great, it did not feel normal and I had very bad dizziness and insomnia that night as the drug began to wear off.. But I wasn&#039;t laying in bed miserably like I did countless nights before, I kind of sat there with a smile so it was actually kind of creepy. That morning I called my physician and asked if this was a normal or okay reaction considering I&#039;ve been told you shouldn&#039;t feel anything for 4-6 weeks. He mentioned that it was &quot;weird&quot; that I had this response but it was a negative one. He recommended I cut my dosage in half and stick with taking 5 kg a day since the 10 obviously overtook my body. Within hours of hanging up I popped half a tablet and can honestly say I felt happy without many side effects. I continued this the following day and my relationship with my boyfriend, family, and friends has greatly improved, I sleep better, I can laugh and actually mean it and I can go in public places without constantly being self conscious. I&#039;ve heard it can have bad results in week 1 and 2 but after taking this medicine for only 3 days, whether it&#039;s the placebo effect or not, has saved me and helped me to return to my normal self."	9-Aug-15
127504	Phentermine	"I went to my doctor because I was 128.6 kgs. My knees were starting to give out, I had terrible insomnia, sore spine, I was constantly sick all the time due to a low immune system so because I never exercised, I always developed a swollen throat and developed constant fevers.   My doctor prescribed me duromine (which is the equivalent of phentermine) and saw the results pretty much immediately. It took me 6 months but I managed to lose 30 kgs just like that. And it keeps falling off. I exercise everyday now, I eat 1400 calories. I&#039;m happier, healthier, I never get sick. People talk to me since I give off a different vibe. I recommend Phentermine to those who are having trouble losing weight."	1-Sep-17
141391	Escitalopram	"After several stressful life events I developed an anxiety disorder which quickly evolved into depression. Originally I started on Citalopram which wasn&#039;t great, only reduced anxiety by 10% at most, pumped Citalopram up to 30mg/ day, no great improvement. Saw a psychiatrist (who worked with me to start the medication merry-go-round) and started Escitalopram (Lexapro). Lexapro had much the same effect as the Celexa but the mood improved a little.  We raised Lexapro from 20-30mg/ day and the anxiety MELTED away, the effect was very pronounced, not totally stress free but no panic attacks and no ever constant anxiety. Tiredness was an issue so we&#039;ve added 5mg/day Edronax (NRI) which has been excellent. Find what works for you - be strong."	2-Sep-14
141298	Escitalopram	"I started taking Lexapro after years of anxiety and constant feelings of doom and gloom, it came to a head about 4 years ago and I was seriously considering suicide, anyway I started going to counseling and taking 20 gms of Lexapro, I worked my way through it and about 2 months ago went cold turkey after cutting down to 10 mg for about 6 months. I got bad head spins and felt really tired but I&#039;m coming good now, the interesting thing is that while I was on Lexapro my craving for beer went through the roof and I went from two stubbies a day to sometimes 20 and couldn&#039;t get enough. I lived for beer, now I&#039;m off  Lexapro I have lost that craving and the beer actually tastes bad so all good. I wonder now whether Lexapro was really doing anything"	18-Dec-14
141494	Escitalopram	"I was at a breaking point and couldn&#039;t take any more bad thought and sad days. It got to the point where I was crying up to 4 times a day, snapping at my husband and kids, having to call in to work because I couldn&#039;t pull it together long enough to function.  It was bad.  I had negative thoughts and obsessed about something bad happening to myself or my daughter and not at the hands of myself.   Side effects were bad at first-insomnia, nausea, swimmy head, anxiety, those only lasted until about day 5 and was told to push through and tough it out.  Every day since has been better and better and I finally feel normal again.  Lexapro saved my life."	23-Aug-13
34129	Tramadol	"My dentist perscribed Tramadol yesterday because of an abcessed tooth.  I see an Endodontist this morning.  It helped with pain, but I have not slept one minute all night.  My mind raced all night.  I was so sleepy, but if I closed my eyes I had movie like images racing.  I have never been on any kind of &quot;speed&quot; but I feel like this is what it would be like."	5-Aug-09
128526	Phentermine	"I took Phentermine from 5/27 until around 6/27 and lost 13 pounds with zero exercise. I lost weight but I took June till July off today I started my second round. I also started working out for 30min-1hour. I&#039;m excited to see what the second round does for me."	24-Jul-15
96972	Ambien	"I have been taking ambien or zolphidem for almost 15 years. I had horrible insomnia where I couldn&#039;t sleep sometimes at all during the night. The insomnia went on for about 2 years before I tried ambien. it worked immediately.  I don&#039;t take it every night and when I do I break off a third of the pill. The only side effect is sometimes grogginess in the morning. I worry about a little memory loss. I was told it disrupts your REM sleep which can affect memory. Trying to get off completely but don&#039;t want to go through that horrible insomnia again."	7-Nov-15
95804	Sertraline	"I started taking Zoloft about a month ago, in the first week i had some diarrhea and experienced some insomnia, but it soon disappeared. Within three weeks my depression and anxiety subsided. This medication changed my life."	18-Jan-14
64299	Sertraline	"My doctor prescribed this for depression issues/severe anxiety associated with adult ADD. I was very resistant to try, have been put on multiple other meds that made things much worse. I take 50mg daily. Immediately felt almost &quot;euphoric.&quot; With each passing day, I feel better in every sense, and the anxiety is gone. I NEVER write any posts EVER, but this has been an unbelievable game changer. I have been battling these issues since childhood, and I can truly say I feel happy and hopeful about my future. The &quot;internal storm&quot; inside that I battled every day to cope with is gone. No side effects except for some vivid, strange dreams-but those are dissipating. I hope this helps someone-if this one doesn&#039;t help, keep trying and never give up."	2-Oct-16

I am bipolar 1 and also take lithium, propranolol, gabapentin, Vistaril and Klonopin.  The main problem was that more recently I have begun having rapid cycling manic episodes forcing me to begin tapering off."	13-Jan-14
138839	Phentermine	"I got put on PHENTERMINE 37.5 in March of 2010 and my weight when I started taking it was 242. Now November 2010 my weight is 162.7lbs, and from a size 18 to a 10/12 2X to a Large. I&#039;ve always struggled with my weight, have tried every diet nothing worked like this does. At my all time highest weight which was 350 lbs, size 4X and 28 in jeans due to depression. So now in my 30&#039;s I&#039;m looking better then I have ever looked my whole life. Phentermine has done wonderful miracles for me. A few side effects, minor ones though..But they were/are at times :headaches (minor); and constipation. Hope this eases those who are terrified and &quot;assume&quot; phentermine will do all these bad things WE heard in the past. "	14-Nov-10
64931	Sertraline	"Although I have only been on this med for 12 days so far. I feel wonderful. I have had severe depression due to being sick the past 3 years and nothing has been helping me get better (spinal nerve damage and severe migraines everyday) ; sometimes I just felt like I wanted to die I felt no hope.I haven&#039;t felt any side effects and my migraines are almost completely gone. I get up and do more around my house, more than ever and I am taking better care of myself. Im happy for the first time in my life. I know most people will think it&#039;s too good to be true; but really you should ask your doctor if it might be for you. I am so glad I am on this; never had a medicine work so good. Hope it last.

72261	Tramadol	"I was in a severe car accident and needed a non narcotic pain medicine that was stronger than over the counter medicines until my bruised ribs healed.  I was given 60 tablets and for the first few days I took it every 4 to 6 hours.  I still have 1/2 the prescription and have not had to use it in about a month.  Tramadol helped with pain and allowed me to function at work and to sleep at night. I would recommend this medicine to everyone."	19-Jun-12
96395	Sertraline	"Side effects, both of which will go away eventually:  dry mouth, nervousness and jitteriness.  The other &quot;side effects&quot; that many mention are actually more in line with symptoms of depression and anxiety. It&#039;s very hard to come off of Zoloft as you WILL get the &quot;electrical shock&quot; effect (if you&#039;ve ever weaned yourself off, you know what I mean). Also, coming off any anti-depressant may cause/allow some rebound anxiety and depression."	21-Nov-09
71963	Tramadol	"The other reviewer is well versed on the intended  This, review is based on my experience with tramadol, which is not controlled in Mexico, where I reside. I moved across the border US to Mex to withdraw from heroine and begin anew. I panicked when withdrawal became reality and tried to get a few doctors to prescribe any opiate pill to no avail. The cab driver took me to a &quot;special&quot; pharmacy where I spent a fortune on a tramadol 100mg bottle. I was so hopeful that my agony would subside. Nada. Nothing. Waste. Garbage. Never again. I must have taken 10-12 pills over six hours. They didn&#039;t mellow me out, the withdrawal steadily got worse over the disappointing six hours as anticipated."	7-Sep-15
141147	Escitalopram	"I am a young and small person who was in search for a medication to control my depression but mostly my anxiety and OCD tendencies. I had tried Lexapro before also mixed with Buspar but it never seemed to fully do the trick; it felt like I was taking a pill and not getting much from it. Prozac has caused maybe a 5 lb fluctuation in my weight and it did decrease my sex drive for about the first 6 to 8 months but I feel that is just the amount of time necessary to get used to the new drug. This has been the only effective solution to my illness."	11-Sep-15
140915	Escitalopram	"I had been feeling some general depression and anxiety for 6-8 months. Nothing specific, just everything seemed to pile up. I felt like I couldn&#039;t get the negative thoughts out of my head. Dr prescribed 10mg Lexapro, I got the generic escitalopram. Day 1, I felt like the anxiety was dissipating, but I did have bad nausea and loss of appetite for 12 days. On the 12th day, I woke up, anxiety is gone, nausea is gone, and I am hungry for the first time in a while. I am hopeful that this isn&#039;t just a &#039;good day&#039;, but that the side effects are finally gone. First 12 days were rough. Stick with the meds, always keep something in your stomach, even if it&#039;s just a cracker, and good luck! For me, plain apple sauce, Canada dry ginger ale were helpful."	28-Dec-15
64893	Sertraline	"I have been treated for major depression all of my adult life. Over the years I have taken many different drugs for depression. Zoloft works best of all I have tried so far. It took about 2 weeks to really start feeling the difference so be patient."	16-May-15
72196	Tramadol	"I&#039;m 31. After 10 yrs of sciatica pain caused by bulging discs and fracture I was prescribed tramadol. They are amazing. No side effects. And no pain, only take 30 mins to kick in. They help me so much in my heavy lifting job. I take them when I&#039;m in a lot of pain. Other times I just try deal with the pain."	26-May-14
138895	Phentermine	"I just get really constipated and have to be laxating 2 times a month if not once every week. I was 213lbs and now I weigh 183lbs so I lost 30 lbs in 3 months."	14-Dec-09
139209	Phentermine	"I started taking this diet pill about 2 1/2 yrs ago and in 3 mths had lost 45 lbs. I was thrilled with the results and had decided to stop taking it. I kept the weight off for 1 1/2 yrs. But in the past year I have gained back 15 lbs. So I made an appointment to see my doctor. I love this miracle pill."	26-Jun-08
138866	Phentermine	"I have started taking Adipex 5 days ago and I have lost eight pounds already. This is a wonderful drug. I have been on and off of it for years. You can lose weight very fast with this pill. It really works if you want to lose weight. You may experience dry mouth. You don&#039;t feel hungry, you have to make yourself eat. I haven&#039;t been doing any kind of workouts, but plan to start. I go back to my doctor 8-26-10. She said that I would have to lose 6 pound if I want to get more. I started out at 187 and now I am 179."	3-Aug-10
64716	Sertraline	"I have been taking 50mg of Zoloft for a month now. At first I was nauseous everyday and wanted to stop so bad. I stayed with it and I can really feel a difference. I seem to be able to think more clearly and just in a better mood altogether. I have suffered from major depressive and extreme anxiety disorder since about the age of 13. I&#039;m almost 32 now and for once I actually feel good. This speaks in volumes for those that know me. I&#039;m not sure if I will need to increase the dosage ever but for now the 50mg seems to be the magic happy pill I&#039;ve been looking for my whole life. Also I may be one of the few but it seems to have increased my sex drive. Weird huh!"	11-Oct-15

128427	Phentermine	"I am down 13 pounds in 10 days of taking this medication .. haven&#039;t eaten much since starting so I&#039;m pushing the fluids to keep hydrated. No exercise but I&#039;m a Mom of 4 so Im kept busy run l moving around after kids. Jitters insomnia dry mouth and dizziness are some side effects I&#039;ve had but hoping that my body adjusts to the medicine soon."	19-Oct-15
71639	Tramadol	"I use tramadol as an alternative to triptans like Amerge and Imitrex. Unfortunately I get 20 - 25 migraines a month. I am scheduled for a meds update with my neurologist and will be giving Botox a try. I have been more concerned about the rebound issue than addiction. A one month refill lasts me more than four and on those wonderful days that I don&#039;t have pain, I don&#039;t take it. Those periods can run from 3 - 6 days. The tramadol rarely kills 100% of the pain, but I&#039;m usually functional. The Amerge and Zomig were giving me terrible stomach pain and palpitations. Tramadol has been very helpful for me without any issues. However I do make a point of regularly reviewing my usage with my doctor."	4-Oct-17
141743	Escitalopram	"Hi, I&#039;m a recently divorced dad with 3 children. My entire life was turned upside down and inside out. I lost all my friends, went from being financially secure to having a 500k mortgage at the age of 47. I was living in total darkness and totally dysfunctional, finding faults, especially in my current partner and her children. My self esteem was non existent. I&#039;m taking Lexapro 10 mg a day and now I feel like I could carry the entire universe on my shoulders and could concur the world."	13-Apr-11
64472	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been on 200mg for 7 months now, yes you can tell a difference. Makes the constant thinking diminish a little, especially under pressure. Ask you doctor if sertraline is right for you. "	27-Jul-16
128353	Phentermine	"I started this medicine for weight loss...I have type 2 dm with PCOS. I started adipex on 10/30/15. My weight was 260lbs and was very unhappy. My first week on this pill I lost 10lbs and the next week I weighed in a 245lbs  15lbs in two weeks!!!  Its amazing results. I had major side effects ranging from headaches, upset stomach, diarrhea, blankness and heart racing, I stuck with it and only thing I have a problem is the diarrhea and upset stomach....I weigh myself tomorrow for the third week...the energy I have now is unbelievable...I&#039;m really happy I chose this..."	19-Nov-15
127610	Phentermine	"I started on 37.5 mg. of phentermine yesterday, May 15. I had planned on starting with a half a pill, to see how it would be, but they are capsules prescribed by my primary physician, so I had to take a whole one. I have had no harsh side effects, thus far. I took it early in the morning and it did not disrupt my sleep last night. I did the same today. It definitely curbs my appetite and I have to make sure I remember to eat now. I am 5&#039; 11&quot; and weigh 200lbs. My goal is to continue with this medicine and eating healthy, along with exercise. Good luck to all who try this med."	16-May-17
64691	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been suffering with depression coupled with anxiety for over 10 years.  Its been hell ruining every aspect of my life (loss of relationships, my business etc.) After seeing so many psychiatrists I had lost hope and was getting very close to ending my life so tried to get help one more time.  For the first time I met a young Doctor who listened.  He prescribed me Zoloft 50mg.  The change = I left my house within 2 weeks (major agoraphobia for 8 months) started talking to people, going out again with friends, preparing to launch my business again and I feel happy. Not manic, HAPPY and measured. I&#039;m praying that I stay this way.  There is hope out there. Don&#039;t give up guys. :)"	18-Dec-15
128745	Phentermine	"Started 3/19. Day 3. Haven&#039;t weighed myself yet- waiting to hit the week mark. Haven&#039;t experienced dry mouth. But I am dealing with insomnia. Was up at 6am yesterday. Currently 3am the next day. Not tired at all. I do have energy though and a decreased appetite. So the medication is serving its purpose."	21-Mar-15
64991	Sertraline	"Zoloft has been a life saver for me. I honestly don&#039;t know how I would&#039;ve gotten through the past year without it. I had anxiety and depression, but after I started taking Zoloft, I was finally starting to feel myself again and my headaches have gone away. If you have moderate to severe anxiety and depression, I would highly recommend this. It truly saved me."	25-Dec-14
64365	Sertraline	"Started taking for depression , works stops my irrational temper tantrums. I have been on it for 2 years. I was also a heavy drinker ( bottle and half wine a night for 20 years) but after taking this drug for 3 weeks  I stopped drinking and I haven&#039;t had a drink for 2 years, no withdrawal or craving for alcohol . I feel and look good for my age despite struggling with the menopause and a under active thyroid. It works , you may loose a bit of weight to begin with but the appetite does come back to normal . I would not say I am happy but then life circumstances can take their toll if your depressed or not but I certainly function well, stay sober and I have hope in the future.  Only downside is I cannot get off them."	30-Jul-16

128621	Phentermine	"I weighed 285 when had my first daughter in February of 2013. I lost all my baby weight and got down to 255 but quickly gained most of it back from the breastfeeing  (exclusively breastfed for 15 months. I had daughter number two in November 2014 and weighed 278. I quickly lost the baby weight once again and got down to 255 but had even worse cravings this time (breastfed only 4 months). Even after I quit breastfeeding my cravings continued. I felt like I was always hungry, nothing satisfied me and I could never get full. Not to mention my energy level was lower than ever. I joined the ymca but didn&#039;t have much luck with that due to my eating habits and lack of energy. I started Adipex yesterday (May 13) and weighed in at 275. WILL CONTINUE"	14-May-15
95994	Sertraline	"I was on Zoloft for about 5 years. Before that I was on Effexor and Paxil which I did not tolerate well due to the half life. Zoloft was good but after several years I developed side effects. Tremor, jaw clenching, weight gain, sexual dysfunction...I weaned myself off of all meds which was really hard. It&#039;s been nearly a year and I&#039;m ready to go back on something. I&#039;ve tried natural therapies for SADD, PMDD, depression, anxiety and it&#039;s not working."	24-Mar-13
127994	Phentermine	"Had my first follow up today, been on Phentermine for 25 days and I&#039;m down 19 lbs. Few side affects...cotton mouth, anxiety occasionally like twice a day for a brief period and constipation which has lead to hemorrhoids. But, given the success of 19 pounds in 25 days, they side effects are definitely not severe enough to stop. I thought about stopping if the weight wasn&#039;t coming off but it definitely is. I encourage you to use my fitness pal and track what you eat as well. I&#039;m a 6&#039;4 male that started at 322 pounds. All I eat is between 1200-1500 calories per day and feel great!"	10-Oct-16

96345	Sertraline	"I started using Zoloft for anxiety and minor depression. It has been a God send. I was overwhelmed and lethargic- now I am back to myself- I have energy again. I had the typical side effects for the first few weeks, but they have subsided. No weight gain or sexual side effects for me. I am very happy with the results. Everyone is different, and the medications are all different so remember to talk to your doctor if after 6 weeks you don&#039;t feel different or worse."	9-Sep-09
96837	Ambien	"Ambien or &#039;Zolped...&#039; was terrible. I started hallucinating. Now, I do drink caffeine in the morning but it should not have this koo koo effect. My ceiling turned into peaceful, lit-up jellyfish tentacles and my pillow turned into a moving/billowing cloud of a worm. Pretty crazy but that is what I saw when I took this crap. I was dazed... it didn&#039;t initially help me fall asleep. Perhaps I&#039;m allergic to Ambien, I have no idea. I believe I took it with 5 or 10mg of melatonin. Whew... that was a cocktail to go nuts. Stick with Tamazepam (Restoril)... way better"	19-May-17
96492	Sertraline	"Zoloft/Sertaline has allowed me to continue doing the job and living the lifestyle I love. Not only did it lift me out of the dark pit of depression, it has helped me cope with high-anxiety periods of intense stress - on a minimal dosage and without any side effects."	11-Mar-09

There are some negative side effects, dry mouth and constipation being the most annoying but I had no jitters or changes in sleep. I&#039;m 47 and am 5&#039;5 with a goal weight of 140."	30-Aug-15
128390	Phentermine	"Im in my 30 5&#039;6 and my starting weight was 276. In the first month I lost 24 pounds. The second month I lost 8 more. I stopped because I felt like my body was getting accustomed to it. So one month later I went to the doctor to get more pills. I started taking a week ago and I lost 10 more pounds. From the beginning I watch what I ate. I drank water and when I was tired of drinking water I would drink a small bottle of powerade to get some flavor. The doctor told me to be on a 1200 calorie diet but I choose 500 to help the process. I was a size 22 and now I&#039;m between 16 and 18 depending on the clothing. So I lost a total of 45 pounds being actively on the pill for 2 months 1 week. Im happy...can&#039;t complain."	28-Oct-15

I have sever arthritise in my back. The tramadol helps me to be able to resume my life some what, with out the agonizing pain that I live with. I take 50 mgs 4x a day. I do not feel as if I need my dosage uped after this long. Iseem to do just fine. I can have my grandchilderen, work in my garden, and do genral houshold chores. In general I can continue a fairly normal life."	30-Jun-15

64022	Sertraline	"This medication  has changed my life and probably saved my marriage. I can think clearly function effectively and my anxiety is controlled. I can now enjoy all the things I used to . I have had depression and anxiety for most of my life , I am on 50 mg at the moment which seems to suit me perfectly. But there is scope to increase if necessary."	28-Feb-17
96053	Sertraline	"For three months I suffered from debilitating nausea (without vomiting).  I couldn&#039;t get out of bed because I constantly felt like I was going to vomit.  It was absolutely horrible and I could not figure out what was wrong with me.  I&#039;ve always been an anxious/stressed out person but never thought that it was out of the ordinary.  Finally my family forced me to go to the doctor and she told me that because of my upcoming life events (getting married, starting a new career, moving out) and because of my Type A personality, it&#039;s likely I have a slight chemical imbalance in my brain which could be causing my extreme nausea.  I was so reluctant to take the sertraline, but am SO glad that I did!  My nausea is GONE and I can live life again!"	18-Dec-12
141661	Escitalopram	"My story is really long and complicated. I was originally on Xanax and all it did was make me sleep. Switched doctors because my original doctor wouldn&#039;t switch me off the Xanax. New doctor prescribed me Lexapro. I was upset at first because I didn&#039;t feel I needed it, I thought Lexapro was an anti-depressant and I wasn&#039;t depressed.. About a month after I started taking the Lexapro I felt amazing! But then I lost my health insurance so they put me on Paxil. I miss my Lexapro! It was the best."	22-Jul-12

214674	Escitalopram	"I have been on this for over 18 months.   I went from stress starving myself I was so anxious and so much more to my old weight and a healthy outlook about myself and others. My dosage varied between 10mg up to 40mg during a rough stretch.   The only thing I will say is that even though it is a far-flung side effect for some, the decreased libido was the only downside for me. Mine was never hyper but it had a dull edge on it. At a lower dosage there is no loss of it but be mindful."	21-Aug-17
95753	Sertraline	"Not helping for my Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. On max dose now, and still nothing. I get this feeling of the skin on my head contracting...I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s normal."	25-Oct-14

I ran out on December 26th, 2015 and didn&#039;t have the money to get them again until the 31st of December.  I ate like a monster those four days and was certain I&#039;d gained like 30 lbs, but I still weighed in at 186 on the 31st when I started taking them again and I&#039;m excited to see how much I can lose this month! I have a gym membership and try to go to at least one Zumba class a week, but it&#039;s hard sometimes during the week so I can&#039;t say any of the weight loss is attributed to exercise. Prior to taking the pills I cut out most carbs and all breads from my regular diet."	3-Jan-16

72226	Tramadol	"More powerful than I thought... dr prescribed this to treat scoliosis pain in a &#039;non narcotic way&#039;. It helped my back pain greatly. I was also in a great mood in the beginning. I thought it was wonderful (despite a constant minor headache)! As the months went on, I no longer had that wonderful feeling and needed the tramadol to function. NEVER went over prescribed dose (50 mg 3 times per day). When I had to take it at 7:30 am so I could get out of bed at 8:00, I knew it was a problem. Seems you can become dependent without really knowing it. BAD withdrawals that lasted over a month (I was on it 11 months)."	4-Aug-13

Did moderate activity, but had weekly binge episodes (could not seem to control the hunger). Been tired and gaining the weight back since. My Doctor just gave me a clean bill of health, even though I&#039;m back to 210lbs and prescribed Phentermine 37.5mg. I start tomorrow... Plan to update here at 2 weeks and after my 30 day check-up. I have started walking 2x a day 5x a week and doing yoga 3 x a wk, and went back to Weight Watchers online to keep me accountable for my diet. Fingers crossed!"	8-Apr-10

141988	Escitalopram	"My psychologist originally suggested Lexapro to treat my anxiety and panic disorder, then my doctor prescribed it. I was told that it is not habit forming and that it has low side effects and works well to treat panic disorder. I started out on 10mg for 3 weeks then went up to 20mg. My side effects have been mild and have included nausea (the first few days), weight loss (which I don&#039;t mind) because of decreased appetite, mild increased sweating, and recently trouble falling asleep. All in all I am very pleased with it and have had only one panic attack in over a month. I used to have multiple ones weekly. I feel like I am finally getting my life back and I would recommend this medicine to anyone."	8-Jul-09
71772	Tramadol	"After total knee replacement and now the other knee is painful, nothing worked like tramadol. I had oxycodone, hydrocodone, did not work at all. One tramadol 50mg in the early morning and one at bedtime works wonders for me, makes pain more tolerable and helps me sleep at night. I don&#039;t know ehst I&#039;d do without it."	4-Jan-17

71819	Tramadol	"I was prescribed Tramadol for depression a year ago (50 mg, 3x day).  I felt like I had the flu so I stopped after 3 days. About 1 1/2 months ago I started to take it again (only 1- 50 mg per day in AM).  I currently take adderrall and xanax as they are the only meds that help my depression /anxiety without the terrible side effects. Since on Tramadol I have been more motivated and productive then I can ever remember!  I stopped for a couple days and experienced the flu like symptoms again, but I have gone back again on a regular daily schedule.  Not sure if I should up the dosage to 100 mg but this has been the best med for me, and I&#039;ve taken many. Definetly a life changer and I&#039;m optimist about the future for the 1st time in my life."	14-May-16
78439	Allegra	"I took the standard dose as prescribed. And not even 30 minutes later I&#039;m sneezing like crazy and nose is running like Niagara falls. Its claims of 24hr relief is garbage."	24-Apr-16
128795	Phentermine	"I started Phentermine, prescribed by my primary care physician, and it has been nothing short of amazing in my case.  I started taking it at 372.4 pounds. Within a matter of 4 days of taking the medication I noticed a HUGE change.  This gives me energy, and makes me feel not hungry at all.  In 5 days, I lost  11.3 pounds.  I don&#039;t have any of the nasty side effects that everybody mentions, but medications affect people differently.  I take the Phentermine EVERY day at the SAME time, and am already noticing a difference.  Along with not making you feel hungry, when you do eat, it makes you feel full.  FAST."	9-Jan-15
141230	Escitalopram	"This is the first time I have ever posted a review of anything online, but I feel an obligation to share my experience to other suffering with anxiety. I suffer from GAD which included panic attacks, muscle aches, and a horrible temper.  I avoided this medication fearing weight gain (as I already gained 10 lbs over the year) and sexual dysfunction.  When I explained this to my doctor, he replied &quot;Have you ever considered whether being anxious has caused you to eat more, drink more, and maybe have sex less often?&quot;. I have been on Lexapro for 6 months now, and my only regret is not starting this treatment sooner. I have lost 15 lbs as I don&#039;t eat and drink as much anymore, and my love life has improved. Anxiety sucks. You don&#039;t have to suffer!"	26-May-15
119783	Ambien CR	"My problem isn&#039;t getting to sleep..it&#039;s STAYING asleep. I have found that after trying Lunesta (nasty-nasty aftertaste for an entire day afterwards..and the hangover!) I much prefer Ambien but it has to be &quot;CR&quot; ...and crystal clear the next day. Never had any problem with after effects..ever. Problem is..Dr stopped prescribing sleep aides as too addictive, however even after reminding him that the last bottle of 50 lasted me about three years..he still wasn&#039;t willing. This needs to be over the counter. "	1-Sep-14
64443	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been on Sertraline for 4 weeks now for PMDD, OCPD and anxiety.  At first I actually felt really great.  Even felt like it held off my PMDD symptoms until just a few days prior to my cycle.  However could still feel the symptoms of my PMDD so I had my 4 wk chk up w my Psych.  I asked to be increased to 100mg to which he agreed.  However before I had a chance to pick up the new script - I noticed that the day I ended my cycle my PMDD symptoms hadn&#039;t  subside like they usually do.  I feel spaced out am having anxiety worse than before, feel irritable, dizzy and am even experiencing a little bit of depression which was never a symptom I suffered from prior.  I am afraid to up the meds for fear of these side effects? getting worse."	14-Jun-16
141505	Escitalopram	"It helps with anxiety but actually causes depression for me. Plus, I&#039;ve gained weight, even when on a starvation type diet. I&#039;m slowing weening myself off, down to 2.5 mg a day, next  week I&#039;m stopping completely.  I just want to have a clear head, instead of feeling like a zombie."	27-Jul-13
97279	Ambien	"99% of the time I will lay awake all night if I do not take Ambien. Reading or computer play will not put me to sleep."	29-Oct-08
78419	Allegra	"My husband got a very acute urtricaria on his whole body for 2 weeks. Nothing helped really to get rid of the burning patches. Benadryl caused more drowsiness then any help and additionally my husbands face was sweeling all over when taking Benadryl. Finally we got Allegra 180 mg pills. And just after the first Allegra pill all red patches on his skin and all swollen areas were gone for good as long as he keeps taking it twice a day 180 mg each tablet. This medicine is really great."	27-Feb-12
141759	Escitalopram	"This drug did very well for me initially, at 10mg.  My dosage over 7 years kept increasing and now I am convinced that over time this medicine will deplete your natural serotonin levels and fails to work or not work at all.  At 10mg the side effects were not that noticeable at all, but at 20 mg the side effects were much more pronounced  Especially lethargy, increased panic attacks/anxiety, weird dreams, and sexual side effects to name just a few. Everyone is different, but for me this drug worked well at a small does for about 21/2 years, then slowly stopped working to the point where I was just having side effects from the med.  Am tapering off it and feel very well so far."	6-Mar-11
141703	Escitalopram	"It&#039;s not for me at all. Last night was the worst night of my life, it started about two weeks into taking Lexapro my friends and family said that they noticed changes but I felt more depressed than I have ever felt. The next two weeks into it I started feeling really off balance and trembly. Then last night happened, without warning, without a trigger, as I was trying to fall asleep I started getting lost in my head. I was forgetting how to think and I was forgetting words. It terrified me. "	4-Nov-11
71669	Tramadol	"Tramadol used on top of my Fioricet, or Midrin. For head ache was somewhat effective. Used when the pain of the head ache  has reached a point where I&#039;m on the verge of nausea, and vomiting, once the other baseline abortives have failed. When used with the Fioricet/Codeine it works quite well, at knocking it out, otherwise just Tramadol even at doses of 200mg is only a dent in the pain."	11-Apr-17
138635	Phentermine	"Started taking Adipex-P 4 weeks ago. Cons: Constipation and really bad bouts of Insomnia - better as time has gone on. Do not take with a blood pressure pill/water pill - you will feel like crap and your heart will try to burst through your ribcage. Pros:  Lost 31 pounds.  17 pounds - yes 17 pounds in 1 week though I do attribute that to the Adipex-P   Blood Pressure/water pill. I found I could not take both at the same time or on the same day so I stopped taking the blood pressure pill. My blood pressure is down to where it should be.  Working out 4-5 times a week. 4-5 miles of cardio per workout plus weights. Probably cut my daily calorie intake by half.  I plan on taking the pill for a max of 3 months so by summer I should be off the pill but still have a more active life."	12-Apr-12
72607	Tramadol	"Have had Fibromyalgia for 17 years, just diagnosed this year. Was prescribed Ultram for worst pain days. Almost completely takes the pain away with 100mg. Little to no side effects. First couple times I took it, I felt a little drowsy. I am very happy that my rheumatologist recommended this medication. To get some pain relief and still feel like myself is all I could hoped for! Would recommend."	25-May-10
96072	Sertraline	"33 year old Male, affected by anxiety and bouts of depression all my life.  Went through a bad breakup in &#039;10 and was severely depressed, got on 50mg of Sertraline and took for 4 months after experiencing horrible panic attacks and suicidal thoughts after trying Lexapro.  Earlier this year had another fall into anxiety and depression, started on 50mg of Sertraline and experienced diarrhea, panic attacks, nausea, sweating, insomnia, mood swings, fatigue, etc during the first couple weeks.  After 5 weeks I am feeling much better and just upped the dosage to 75mg.  I experienced about 10-15 lbs weight loss in the first 2-3 weeks from not being able to eat but otherwise the only side effects are slight loss of sexual desire and sensitivity."	8-Jul-12
138864	Phentermine	"I went to the doctor for lower back pain/leg pain and I knew I was overweight from keeping the baby weight on from 1 year ago. He suggested Adipex to help get me motivated. I started the pill the end of February at 191 (5&#039;10) and by the end of July I am now 144. I went off the pill for 2 months in May/June. Now on it again for just a couple months. I will take a break over the winter and see how I do. I found out that I lost more weight when I did not work out. Now I am starting to work out to tone up.  Love the new me."	7-Aug-10
64890	Sertraline	"I just got back on it but use to take it for years and I was happiest when on Zoloft."	18-May-15
128289	Phentermine	"I did take this  10 years ago. It really worked, can&#039;t remember how much weight I lost. It was a significant weight loss!  Since then, I have gained weight and lost it on my own. I am now 50. I only know of one Dr. That prescribes it. I saw him today. I am 50, my metabolism is not the same as it was.... Started it today,  the cost has gone down!!!"	11-Jan-16
71873	Tramadol	"Tramadol is a drug that does not work for everyone. I found that different generic brand of tramadol work better than others. I have had the best luck with teva and mylan. The others give me a horrible headache, and dont do anything for my back pain. Also the less you take the better off you are. I take 6 pills a day that are 50mg. I take them 2 at a time every 8 hours. Some people have a hard time finding mylan , teva , and northstar generics. You just have to do the leg work. I get the mylan at walmart. Most places have amneal, and caraco because its cheaper. I can say the brand name ultram is the best by far, and cvs will order it for me, but 180 pills is way to much for me. If you can afford the brand name ultram go for it."	18-Jun-16
128541	Phentermine	"I&#039;m praying I have similar success to some of these stories I&#039;ve read. I just started Phentermine 37.5 mg today, 7/10/15. I&#039;m 44, 5&#039;2&quot; and 229 lbs. So far, I feel great today. A little bit revved up, but not too bad.  Absolutely no hunger at all. Very thirsty - but that&#039;s a good reason to slam water instead of soda. I&#039;m giving up all sugary foods and drinks.  I want to get back to my comfortable weight of 130-140, and then see where it goes from there. FINGERS CROSSED! I will update more in a couple days. Good luck to all!"	10-Jul-15
95814	Sertraline	"I promised myself I would write a review for this antidepressant. I have only been on them for a month so far and after trying various other antidepressants with negative side effects I can safely say I have found the right one for me! Not only did it stop my anxiety almost immediately but I rarely have any negative or paranoid thoughts. I would definitely recommend anyone who has clinical depression to take these because they have honestly changed my life for the better. Hope this helps."	1-May-14
127907	Phentermine	"I haven&#039;t weighed myself yet because I&#039;ve only been taking phentermine for 4 days now. I am starting to have the dry mouth, but my main concern is that the past 2 days I&#039;ve had off and on numbness/tingling in my left arm and left lower leg. I plan on calling my doctor tomorrow about it. It has me kind of nervous, but other than that I actually have more energy and I&#039;m not hungry at all."	1-Nov-16
127505	Phentermine	"I started these pills on 8/11/2017. I&#039;m 5&#039;3 and weighed 163. Today is 8/31 and I have managed to get down to 152lb. The first 3 days went kinda crazy. Not hungry at all but still ate small portions. To this day I do not crave any sweets, soda or fast food really at all. Which is nuts because I love all that junk! I have been eating very healthy too. Lots of greens and chicken for dinner. Fruit and fiber bar for breakfast. I have cheated a couple times but it&#039;s ok :) I do have more energy during the day. Only thing that sucks is that I have a desk job so its hard to get out. I go walk outside every chance I get. Only 11 pounds so far.  Overall I am pleased with this pill. I will continue to take it and repost in a month or so."	31-Aug-17
34146	Tramadol	"I was prescribed Ultram for a severe sore throat, couldn&#039;t eat or drink. I was taking Cymbalta. The combination caused a seizure. "	25-Jun-09
138652	Phentermine	"I started phentermine on 9/21/11...so far it seems to be working I have a lot more energy then ever."	23-Sep-11
96839	Ambien	"I absolutely love Ambien. Love it. However, building up a tolerance sucks, the drug testing sucks, having to have a doctors appointment monthly to get a prescription sucks, and knowing I&#039;m taking something I know I could become dependent on sucks. No groggy mornings, if taken within a half hour of going to bed I can fall asleep easily, and a few funny text conversations to wake up to. I have tried SO many things and this is so far the only one that has even helped."	10-May-17
96801	Ambien	"I was prescribed 5mg ambien after 3 months of not getting more than 2-3 hours of sleep in each 24 hour period. I had tried benadryl, hydroxyzine, and Valium previously, all of which kept me wide awake. I took the 5mg right before bed, as instructed, and laid there awake all night. The next night I decided to try 1 1/2 (7.5 mg) as I keep reading horror stories about 10mg. I took it, waited about 10 minutes, then went to bed. It took me over an hour to fall asleep, but once I did, I&#039;m thrilled to say I slept all night! Unfortunately even after a full night of sleep it was very hard to wake up. I&#039;d wake up then doze back off. That happened several times for about an hour. Once I was able to wake up enough to get up, I was fine"	22-Feb-17
71932	Tramadol	"Good pain med ."	14-Nov-15
128083	Phentermine	"I&#039;ve been taking phentermine 37.5 for a while now, since June 7, it is now July 20 and I have only lost 8 pounds. I don&#039;t have an appetite at all, I have to force myself to eat, I think it&#039;s only like 1000 calories a day if that. I have really bad heart burn and have some insomnia, other than that I haven&#039;t experienced anything else. I am 5&#039;6 and started off weighing 180, I&#039;m down to 172.   I did have an episode of jitters, tingly arms, rapid heartbeat, and cold sweats but I ate an apple and I felt much better.  I&#039;m not sure if the pill is actually helping me lose weight, since I&#039;ve been on it for 44 days and have only lost 8 pounds."	20-Jul-16
138411	Phentermine	"I love this pill I take a whole pill every morning. I have lots of energy! I started 3 days ago and I have lost 7 pounds since then. It curves my appetite all day until about 5:00pm then I normally eat a piece of grilled chicken and drink water! But I would definitely say that you need to work out along with it because I think that&#039;s how mine is dropping so fast! My doctor told me that if he doesn&#039;t think a patient is losing what they should, he stops prescribing it."	15-Mar-14
128141	Phentermine	"Hello I&#039;m Andrea I am 5&#039;3 and when I started adipex in late Jan I was 202lbs just now starting to slowly stop taking them by skipping days I have had a total weight loss of 38lbs in 3 mn the first month was the quickest results I&#039;ve ate 1200 calories daily drank water like worked out extreme for 4-5 x a week experience headaches due to lack of water sometimes I was dizzy when standing up to fast had many sleepless night from to much energy even though my body was so tired but I feel reborn I feel so happy and confident of course my body image isn&#039;t what I &quot;expected&quot; but my journey has not ended yet. adipex is a tool used to help change your life style I can&#039;t wait to say I changed my lifestyle &amp; no longer need a pill but am thankful 4it"	5-May-16
127984	Phentermine	"I started the 37.5 on 10/15/16 and i felt the jitters and the nausea. I did not feel the burst of energy. I only ate 600 calories on day one. Today is 10/16/16 and I feel more hungry then day 1. I ate a total of 1400 calories today.  I did have a lot of energy....I actually washed baseboards and all. I hope it continues to curb my appetite. So far no bad reports"	17-Oct-16
128303	Phentermine	"Phentermine works great for weight loss. I&#039;ve taken it two different times. I lost 30 pounds in 2 months the first time. The second time I lost 10 pounds in a week but had to discontinue use due to side effects. I had postpartum depression the second time and it made my depression much, much, much worse, and I had horrible &quot;phen rage&quot;. I would definitely suggest talking to your Dr if you struggle with depression before starting Phentermine."	2-Jan-16
140697	Escitalopram	"I have been on 1/2 tablet daily (5mg)  for about six weeks due to anxiety and mild depression.  Within a few days of taking Escitalopram  I started to feel happy and feel this drug is working wonders for me.  I dont know if I want to cease taking it at the moment as I still haven&#039;t solved the problem which caused anxiety.   I have experienced no side effects whatsoever and feel good about the future."	22-Oct-16
63823	Sertraline	"Felt like this drug made my problems a whole lot worse. I had antidepressant-induced mania. I&#039;m now in loads of debt lost my job with a mortgage. Turns out I&#039;m bipolar! These tablets triggered a sweating problem that I&#039;ve not been able to shift in two years"	6-Dec-17
127817	Phentermine	"I&#039;m a male, age 59. I have struggled with weight since childhood, bouncing between 165 (yay) and 215 (nay). I am at 200 and my goal is 165. I love working out, lifting weights and/or doing cardio 6 days per week. But I have always wanted to eat too much and eat the wrong things. Phentermine somehow takes away my life-long preoccupation with food. I have to remind myself to eat. I think, &quot;Is this how normal people feel about food?&quot; I have lost 5 lbs in a week and feel great."	22-Jan-17
96438	Sertraline	"I took this medication for about 3 months and it did relieve my severe depression but the side effects became unbearable for me and I had to change to another SSRI.  This medicine caused headaches, salty dry mouth, insomnia, muscle twitching, nausea, dizziness and a feeling of emptiness."	7-Jul-09
72042	Tramadol	"Did not help at all! Tylenol and ibuprofen are stronger."	2-Jun-15
139035	Phentermine	"I started taking phentermine on October 18, 2008. At that time, I weighed in at 263 lbs. I&#039;m 5&#039;10 so I carry weight very well. As of my weigh in yesterday (April 30, 2009) I&#039;ve lost 41 lbs. The only side effect that I&#039;ve had to deal with is insomnia; but over time, that has gotten easier to deal with. I&#039;d recommend this medication; however, I would also stress that the weight you put on wasn&#039;t put on overnight and therefore, won&#039;t come off overnight. Slow and steady wins the race."	1-May-09
64215	Sertraline	"Alright so I&#039;ve been on 100mg of Zoloft for a while and I&#039;m supposed to start 200mg tomorrow and I&#039;ll be honest, it&#039;s done absolutely nothing for me personally so far.. I&#039;ll be starting Risperidone and coming off this one.    I&#039;ve had no side effects as well as no positive effects what so ever, it&#039;s a very weak medication, basically like drinking water. I guess if your symptoms aren&#039;t bad at all and you want an easy way out of your problems, then this could be the drug for you.    These are the symptoms I experience and trying to medicate: Hypervigilence, jumpiness, sensitivity to sudden noises (like a door slamming shut), only experience emotional &#039;&#039;numbness&#039;&#039; or anger/rage, cloudy mind, disconnection/dissociation/depersonalization, etc."	28-Nov-16

140707	Escitalopram	"I am 25 years old and have been experiencing depression and anxiety since I was about 17. My parents have told me to take this pill for years. I couldn&#039;t get myself to believe that a pill would really change me, actually I couldn&#039;t even admit I had a problem. I thought everyone else had the problems. There would be days where I would be extremely happy and hyper, and then suddenly one thing wouldn&#039;t go my way and I would blow up and say and do things out of anger. I was mean to the people I love most. Unfortunately, my parents are stuck with me as their daughter but my friends had a choice. I have lost many friendships and relationships that I wish I could of kept. Taking a pill everyday isn&#039;t the worse thing in the world, it&#039;s worth it."	14-Oct-16
119746	Ambien CR	"I sleep drove while on Ambien. I had 2 packs of cigarettes when I went to bed and 4 packs when I woke up. This can be a very dangerous. "	10-May-11
95963	Sertraline	"This is the best medicine that I&#039;ve ever been on for depression. I still have some symptoms but I&#039;ve seen a huge improvement in my happiness and social life since I started taking it."	20-Jun-13

64162	Sertraline	"Suffered anxiety for years - rushing thoughts - always tense. Had psycho therapy for a while and although it cleared up a lot of things the anxiety persisted including OCDing over thoughts.  Now after six years on day 4 of this stuff and I feel I got my life back. I feel like me again - no rushing thoughts and i can handle stress much better. So happy !!"	11-Jan-17
128287	Phentermine	"Hello everyone I&#039;ve read all the reviews and I&#039;m so glad too see that this product is loved by so many like me. I&#039;ve been on these pills before and they do work. I just started back Jan 4 weighing in at 207 Dr gave me a goal weight of 199 by next visit and I&#039;m 5&quot;6 ... I beat myself up because I have a hard time making it to the gym but I&#039;ve changed my eating habits. I love that it gives me so much energy I have no problems waking up in the morning .. Herbal Life also works amazingly with these pills. I would drink shake while at work and eat regular meal with my family. I&#039;ve never taken them consistently for a whole month but this month I&#039;m determined to. I&#039;m so excited and can&#039;t wait to drop this weight my overall weight goal is 185"	12-Jan-16
97296	Ambien	"Before I started taking Ambien, I would fall asleep for an hour, wake up and maybe not go back to sleep at all. If I did fall asleep, it would only be for a short time. I sleep solidly from 10pm to 6 am and am no longer tired and run down during the day. That is worth everything."	27-Jan-10
127910	Phentermine	"I started taking it on Wednesday and my energy was up and appetite was down but today is Sunday and my energy is down and my appetite it up...I&#039;ve also stopped licking my lips so no more dry mouth. that&#039;s only day 4. What happened??????"	30-Oct-16
140435	Escitalopram	"I used to suffer from panic attacks frequently that made me feel like I was constantly about to faint or have a heart attack. It was so bad at one point I couldn&#039;t leave the house. I was extremely worried about taking this (probably as a result of GAD I was diagnosed with) but I&#039;ve been on lexapro since November last year and haven&#039;t had a panic attack since! It was hard getting used to lexapro at first and I experienced visual hallucinations upon waking up, but a small dose of valium helped take the edge off. Now anxiety isn&#039;t interfering with my daily life and I barely think about it. I&#039;m now learning meditation, CBT and looking after my physical health so I can wean off the drug later in the year when I&#039;m mentally ready for it"	20-Jun-17
127565	Phentermine	"I been on phentermine 37.5mg and b12 shot since June 16, 2017 and I&#039;m excited when I got it my weight was 242.8 pounds and today June 20 2017  I&#039;m 235 pounds and I have energy and feel like a new person ... Definitely can&#039;t wait to see my final results.... "	20-Jun-17
140690	Escitalopram	"Hi there,  I have been off work for approx 7 weeks due to severe anxiety. I initially started to take Sertraline 50mg however after 4 weeks it made me very low in mood and suicidal hence to swap to Ecitalopram 5mg. I have been taking this for 10 days and already feel a considerable improvement in my overall mood. My anxiety is less and the negative thoughts are manageable. I still worry but things don&#039;t seem so bad anymore. I feel like there&#039;s hope again. I am pleased so far. Good luck"	11-Sep-16
141027	Escitalopram	"I started taking Lexapro nearly two years ago after struggling with generalised and social anxiety for years. I have been taking 5mg consistently. Side effects were noticeable for the first week or so but now I get none at all. No sexual side effects whatsoever. In the time I&#039;ve been taking it I&#039;ve relocated to a new job and had a promotion, motivation through the roof. The negative thought patterns have disappeared."	24-Nov-15

This morning I got on the scale at I&#039;m at 216. I&#039;ve read a lot of reviews and its about %50 people who love it and %50 people who hate it. My main concern is the reviews where people say the minute they stop the pill the weight comes right back plus more. But so far so good for me."	11-Nov-14
97172	Ambien	"Ambien has been a lifesaver for me.  I have had insomnia since I was a teen, and Ambien has been the only medication I have used that works for me.  There are plenty of &quot;strange&quot; things that can happen if you try to do things between the time you take the medication and onset.    IMPORTANT:  If you are going to take Ambien, be IN BED, ready to sleep.  It takes effect VERY quickly.  Great medication for insomnia!"	2-May-12
141947	Escitalopram	"Great drug for me.  I am a 42 yo wife who has been taking Lexapro for 5 weeks and I love it! Only side effect is crazy dreams. Before this I thought of suicide almost daily.  Now, I feel like I can go on. I threw a Halloween party and invited 40 people over.  I&#039;m getting back to the old me. I meet with my doctor in 2 days and I can hardly wait to tell him what a difference this medication has made in my life. I&#039;m so grateful."	2-Nov-09
64357	Sertraline	"Hi- I am a guy from middle east and would like to share my experience with Lustral or Zoloft. I took it for about 7 months with 50 mg per day. It gave me good energy throught the day but couldnt sleep well in the night . The bad side effect that I hate really is low s3xual drive and unable to cum . It gave me some confidence but makes me aggressive . I shared my story coz i always come here and what others are posting . For me I dont know how much it takes to work perfect."	8-Aug-16

128101	Phentermine	"I have an extreme desire for sweets, Eating in the middle of the night. I Definitely lost any desire to exercise (never been like that before)!!! I&#039;m experiencing a dependency on this medication without it controlling my appetite. Within the first 6 months I got results but never reached my goal! Thinking I need more to reach desired weight loss!! Having difficulty with the idea of not taking it anymore even though I do not like my side effects.. Feeling sadness and then extreme happiness all in one day.      I&#039;ve been on this medicine for a year and two months now!!"	18-Jun-16

71913	Tramadol	"I have had chronic joint pain for as long as I can remember and use to eat OTC meds like asprin / Tyenol like candy to reduce the pain but it just gradually worsened over time. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and the start of osteoarthritis in most of my joints. I also suffer from restless leg syndrome. To my surprise , when I went into the hospital to have a heart valve replacement and bypass surgery I was given Tramadol for the pain during my recovery and I noted that about 95% of my pain from the above mention Fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis was relieved as well along with the restless leg syndrome which disappeared completely. I continue to take one tablet daily at about 6 pm and I now feel much better and sleep like a baby at night."	25-Dec-15
141554	Escitalopram	"Lexapro has finally provided stability to my life after about 6 months. I still have a long way to go and alot to do before I feel &quot;Recovered&quot; but the medication has definitely helped with my anxiety."	10-Jun-13
138996	Phentermine	"Weighed in at 218lbs (35  BMI). I started out with Wii-Fit workout 2-30 minute sessions or 60 minutes aerobics 5  days weekly [work up to it] if you hit a plateau, then increase by 10 minutes. Eat 300 calories breakfast, 200 calortie snack 300 lunch 200 snack, 300 dinner. Space meals by 2-1/2 to 3 hours. Use fingers. With Phentermine 37.5 you&#039;ll have to remind yourself to eat, I logged it into my cell phone calendar.  No bottle/canned juices or sodas. Nothing 3 hours before sleeping. Most important limit sugars, starches AND GLUTEN. Set up a pitcher of water in the morning (I add 2 propel packets) to track your water intake. Keep chapstick in your pocket for dry lips. These simple steps and I&#039;m 45 lbs lighter in 70 days. GOOD LUCK! "	28-Aug-09
138629	Phentermine	"I started taking Adipex on 3/21/12. My starting weight was 271.5. Today is 4/25/12 and I weigh 258lbs. I&#039;ve lost a total of 13.5 lbs. I&#039;m certain I could&#039;ve lost WAY more. After over a month, I still have 1/2 a bottle left. The side effects of the pill (rapid heart beat, dizziness from not eating..etc) brought out my pre-existing anxiety issues. I stopped taking it for 2 weeks and got back to eating wrong but I started again a little over a week ago and I&#039;m losing like CRAZY! I weigh everyday and the number keeps getting smaller (side effects are GONE). I sometimes skip a pill, but I still don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m starving like I used to. Will continue to take it until I reach 145lbs. I haven&#039;t exercised, but I did purchase the INSANITY workout and will start soon."	25-Apr-12
95822	Sertraline	"After years of trying different medications sertraline has finally been the most useful and compatible one for me. If only I had found this years ago as it has lifted my depression, improved my social skills and eased my obsessive compulsive disorder symptoms (would trigger after anxiety)."	18-Apr-14
127676	Phentermine	" A previous poster Ryan Smith said &quot;I&#039;ve seen some of the reviews and I have a question for yall how did yall get your doctor to give phentermine to you for 6 months to a year my doctor will only give it to me 1 out of every 3 months&quot; Just to let you know how I get it ...  I am attending a weight loss clinic, look for one in your area, they do weekly weigh ins and check your blood pressure weekly, and at the start they did a complete blood workup. I don&#039;t have a lot to lose, 5&#039;9&quot; and weighed 171lbs. My goal is 150lbs. Today is day 30, I have lost 18lbs. I started out with 1/2 a pill then after 1 week moved up to 1 a day, it really controls my appetite. I am doing this with a Ketogenic diet.It truly works, I&#039;m not hungry."	16-Apr-17
142141	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve been on Lexapro for over a year and have noticed that I&#039;m actually not &quot;freaking out&quot; about everything.  I&#039;m happy for every day that I&#039;m here and thankful for every moment I have.  I only wish I would have approached my doctor before to ask for help.  This little pill made a huge difference."	25-Jun-08

64752	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve suffered with anxiety for years but finally came to a head a few years ago. Had some personal family issues that became overwhelming. I was always mad, sad, frustrated, you name it and that was me. My brain could not stop thinking about my problems. It was very tiring.  I finally went to the doctor and he prescribed Zolft 25 mg. For the first few days I felt like brain waves going on in my head but no big deal. Within 2 weeks I started feeling happy! A few months later the doctor put me up to 50 mg. I felt the brain waves again for about 48 hours and then stopped. I&#039;ve been on Zolft for about one year. It was the best thing I could have done for myself. Oh I can still get mad or sad but not as severe or for as long."	1-Sep-15
97166	Ambien	"I I&#039;ve taken Ambien, and now the generic, for 10 or 11 years. I usually took it only when sleeping away from home. The last month, or so, I&#039;ve needed it every night to fall asleep. I always try to fall asleep on my own first but it has become increasingly difficult. I have absolutely no side effects and never have had. I never get out of bed during the night and feel totally refreshed when I wake in the morning. I don&#039;t know what I&#039;d do without it."	14-Jul-12
128488	Phentermine	"I started on 8/8/15 at 257lbs, tomorrow will be 2 weeks I have been on it and I&#039;m down to 240lbs, that&#039;s down 17lbs!! I work out 4 to 5 times a week,  walking 3 miles or the elliptical for 45 mins. I have cut out all sweets as I noticed foods with a lot of sugar make me shaking while one the pills. I have like no appetite, but make myself eat at least 3 times a day,  I mostly eat fruits and veggies when I do eat. I drink about 8 bottles of water a day due to dry mouth and excessive sweating when working out.   I have only found 2 side effects dry mouth and constipation which I take a stool softener every morning to help with."	21-Aug-15
141144	Escitalopram	"I was on it for almost a year it helped enough I thought I was fine and stopped taking it. Once I was off I hit a low and was put back on it on a higher dose. I&#039;ve been on it now for a year and all together nearly 2 and half. It does help but that doesn&#039;t mean there aren&#039;t still days that are bad and times I don&#039;t feel crappy. But it has made a big enough difference that I&#039;m not trying to hurt myself or kill myself which is good!"	13-Sep-15
96432	Sertraline	"I have been taking 50mg of Zoloft (generic) for almost a week now and have noticed increased fatigue and little to no difference in my mood. I am constantly tired and indifferent to everything, though I do realize it takes time for the medicines to kick in.  I was on Paxil for a month beforehand and felt no effect.  Hopefully Zoloft will do the trick. "	27-Oct-10
128389	Phentermine	"I started taking this medicine exactly 8 weeks ago and my beginning weight was 227 lbs. Last Wednesday I weighed in at 208!! It&#039;s a slow process but I was wearing all sweat pants and long shirts. Now I&#039;m comfortable in jeans and a fitted shirt :) I stopped SODA the 1st week and weighed in 7 lbs lighter! I eat in moderation and excerise 5-6 days out of the week. Biking walking and cardio have been my savior."	28-Oct-15
64093	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been on it for a week and a bit . I gotta say it&#039;s not what I expected.  I&#039;ve never taken anything before , so this is all a first .  Well  I was put on 50mg and that made me extremely sleepy . It was all I did and I couldn&#039;t really do much else .  Went to the doctors and lowered my dose to 25 mg. That seems a lot better . I&#039;m able to get up and do things . I still feel dizzy and don&#039;t really feel like eating . I&#039;m starting to feel better though . I don&#039;t feel like crying and I&#039;m not obsessing or replaying things in my mind . That sharp pain in my stomach has lessen as well."	21-Mar-17
52710	Allegra-D 24 Hour	"I&#039;ve tried other allergy medications but Allegra-D is the only one that works.  I used to get constant post nasal drip and have to clear my throat all the time.  On this medication I feel amazing.  It does however cause insomnia and bad dry mouth.  It also makes it so I don&#039;t get a full erection.  So do I feel better and not have sex or what?"	15-Sep-13
141976	Escitalopram	"I&#039;m a 38 year old female.  I&#039;ve been on Lexapro 10mgs for 2 1/2 weeks now for severe anxiety due to marital issues.  It has definitely helped- I feel much calmer about my life and has given me back the feeling of being able to cope with life&#039;s current problems.  Before starting Lexapro I was taking Valium every couple days for anxiety and I haven&#039;t needed to take a single one since starting.  The one major side effect I noticed almost immediately was difficulty in reaching orgasm (which was never an issue in the past).  I&#039;m not yet sure whether that&#039;s a deal breaker as I think the other SSRIs would have the same effect."	5-Aug-09
71643	Tramadol	"After Meloxicam stopped being effective for my DDD back pain my doctor prescribed Tramadol.  I did feel a little nauseous after taking the first 50MG tablet, but the quick pain relief and reduction in muscle tension was dramatic. The next day I noticed my thoracic back was flexing as I bent over in the shower, the first time in years. It seems to have broken the vicious cycle of pain causing muscle tension and muscle tension causing pain.  My mental state has improved as well, due to being out of pain no doubt.  My sleep is much improved.  I have not experienced nausea taking Tramadol again.  I read here about dependence and withdrawal. so I will reduce my dosage to one 50mg tablet every other day and stop prior to being on it for a week"	10-Sep-17
214660	Escitalopram	"Anxiety has been crazy since moving cities and hard finding work. I can&#039;t calm down. Started lexapro or the generic brand  at 10mg a day. Had orgasm problems first like 4-5 days hard to urinate. Mild head ache. And vivid dreams. But I stuck it out after two weeks side effect mostly went away and doctor instructed to up it to 20mg a day and now I honestly feel no extra side effects most have all gone away already by week 3. I feel a little better about being able to control my anxiety and intrusive thoughts. But still feel kinda depressed and anti social. I&#039;m gonna keep trying tho. Its helped the anxiety already so I think it&#039;ll take longer for everything to settle in. I take it at night cause it makes it sleepy. Wake up fine the next day."	31-Aug-17
64036	Sertraline	"Zoloft is a fantastic AD. It gave me motivation and helped me get back out there into my life. It didn&#039;t work that well for anxiety, but your mileage may vary. Even switching up as little as 50mg would bring back the &quot;punch&quot; if it &quot;pooped out.&quot; Highly recommend."	16-Feb-17
64414	Sertraline	"On day 8 taking 50mg dose and I cannot believe how effective this medication is. I was suffering from anxiety, extreme irritability &amp; low moods for a number of months before my doctor prescribed it for me. So far the only side effect I have experienced is mild headaches, usually in the evening time. I take my dose in the morning after breakfast and I feel so much calmer, good humoured and relaxed - more like the old me. I don&#039;t sweat the small stuff anymore and feel my stress levels have dropped considerably. Fingers crossed this good feeling lasts!"	23-Aug-16
97203	Ambien	"This medicine, combined with 15mg of Remeron (the sedating antidepressant) has improved my quality of life ten-fold! Ambien (zolpidem) works very quickly and puts me to sleep within 20 minutes; Remeron works more slowly and keeps me in a deep, restful sleep. I&#039;ve tried both medicines in isolation, with limited success. Taking only zolpidem gives me a short sleep of  about 4 hours.  On its own, Remeron will put me to sleep for 7-9 hours but takes two hours to start working. The combination of the two is perfectly synergistic!  It&#039;s the &quot;silver bullet&quot; to my insomnia and low-grade depression, which I&#039;ve had all of my 35 years. I&#039;ve never been happier or healthier!"	14-Aug-10
78411	Allegra	"Best allergy medicine I have tried. Works for normal allergies, and even helps with rashes and other allergic reactions."	13-Feb-13
141793	Escitalopram	"My Doctor started me on Xanax.  It helped with anxiety but it was a take as needed. I felt like I was waiting for a bomb to drop waiting for that lost feeling.  My Doctor switched me to Lexapro.  I&#039;ve been on it for a week now, and I feel like my old self.  I&#039;m amazed, and so is my family with the difference in my mood.  I feel so grateful."	7-Feb-11
64394	Sertraline	"Took 25mg and thought I was going to die. Worst medicine ever. I have never been so sick in my life. Was not even able to take care of my child for two days bc I was so sick. All from one half of a pill. Beware of this medicine. I had problems breathing."	1-Sep-16
140659	Escitalopram	"I suffered a bad panic attack my senior year of college and that experience seemed to open the floodgates of anxiety that I had been keeping dormant most of my life. It was tough for me to get out of the house, go to the gym, see friends and family for months. I finally broke down to my mom and she suggested seeing a therapist. At first I was hesitant to take any meds but I finally gave in and started 10mg of generic Lexapro. Worked wonders and felt fantastic. I stopped taking it a year or so later thinking that I was &quot;cured&quot;. Let me tell you, that was a mistake. My GAD has come back with a vengeance. Started up on the 10 mg lexapro about 10 days ago and I almost feel worse. Maybe it&#039;s just taking its time now but I&#039;m hopeful it will be ok."	29-Mar-17

128517	Phentermine	"I started taking Adipex on 7/14/15 and I&#039;m already down 13 pds. Today is 7/31/15. I do workout daily for 1 hr but it&#039;s hard to eat all the time. I have to make myself eat. The problem that I am having now is in the afternoon after my wkout classes I&#039;m hungry but I stick with low calorie options.  Can someone shed some light on staying full all day... Oh yea and the sleep pattern is out the window!"	1-Aug-15
72175	Tramadol	"I received this medication through my PCP for horrendous arthritis pain. This medicine is a joke! Like taking baby aspirin!"	22-Aug-14

95797	Sertraline	"I&#039;m 16, and over the course of a few months I started becoming more and more depressed and anxious, after trying a few other medications along with none at all (only therapy), I started taking Zoloft as it has helped others in my family. The first 10 days (started at 25mg) were horrible, suicidal thoughts, no appetite, headaches and terrible anxiety but once I hit 2 weeks I felt so much better. I&#039;m now 6 weeks in and on 75mg, I feel amazing, still get headaches but I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s related, I feel almost 100% myself, I&#039;ll give it a few more weeks and see if I need to maybe get to 100mg but honestly this medication saved my life."	2-Feb-14
128637	Phentermine	"Just got back in the pill as of 6/11/15 really suppressed my appetite and boosted my energy. But I just wanted to give y&#039;all a heads up. I paid $12 for my prescription by using a coupon"	12-Jun-15
141461	Escitalopram	"Obsessive Compulsive Disorder - always in Limbo. Have only been on Cipralex (5mg) a few days and I already feel better. I have been an OCD sufferer for years, tried nearly all medications and only Prozac worked but the side effects made me stop. Without medicines I was getting worse and now I hope to start getting my life back. On such a low dose I have no side effects. Hoping all you guys with OCD get better."	2-May-14
119804	Ambien CR	"I have been taking Ambien CR for about 6 months now. I have had no side affects. I have not gotten up and got on the computer or driven to any place that I was not aware I was going. It helps me not to have nightmares. If you need something to help you sleep then take it. "	7-May-08
96079	Sertraline	"I had mild panic attack disorder. I started taking the pill and there was a very light headache the first week that went away. I also woke up twice in the first two weeks feeling nausea, but I put up with it. Now I feel fine and I&#039;m a lot happier. I don&#039;t like taking pills but my doctor thinks I should stay on it for at least one year."	2-Jun-12
139105	Phentermine	"I am 5&#039;4 female and am 32 years old. On June 3rd of 2008 I started taking Phentermine. I weighed 185lbs. Just took half of a pill a day because a whole one was too much for me. I took the pill for 3 months, I stopped on September 3rd of 2008. I weighed 140 lbs. It was amazing how the pounds just dropped. Now almost 5 months later I still weight 140 lbs. I weigh myself once a week just to make sure I am still 140 lbs. The most I have weighed since I stopped taking the pill was 144 lbs but it was after the holidays. I love Phentermine."	24-Jan-09
64139	Sertraline	"My recommendation - if you have a panic disorder, get on situational meds like klonopin or xanax. This may not be a wise decision if you have an addiction problem/addictive personality, but klonopin saved my life. Before klonopin, though, I took zoloft. Zoloft made me incredibly sick and very depressed. I have never had depression, only the panic disorder. Situational meds reminded me what it felt like to be normal, and after awhile I was able to mimic that normalcy on my own."	6-Apr-17
64392	Sertraline	"I have been on 50mg of Zoloft for a little over 3 weeks now. For the first week I noticed no change then gradually I was feeling better. It has given me more energy and i feel I have a more positive attitude. I was overeating a lot due to stress and depression that has completely subsided. Since I started taking it I have lost 19 pounds. That has also really helped with my depression. I am scared of my body getting used to it and go back to my regular habits. As for now I am happy."	4-Sep-16
140831	Escitalopram	"I was put on Klonaphin and Xanax for anxiety and depersonalization when i was 16. A doctor switched me from klonaphin to lexapro without any wearing. I have horrible withdrawl from the klonaphin and almost gave up on the lexapro cause i thought it was giving me these side effects. After just a few weeks i felt great! I didnt even notice until one day i sat and thought &quot;hey im happy and i feel great!&quot; 5 years later some anxiety and ocd is peaking threw. Dont be discouraged. This medicine isnt a cure-all but it works wonders. Give it a chance."	5-Jun-16
141260	Escitalopram	"I was prescribed Lexapro for Depression, 10mg/day. I have been suffering from depression for nearly 2 years now, and I finally forced myself to seek medical help. I&#039;m only on day 3, but I can honestly notice a slight positive change already. Day 1 &amp; 2 have been a bit difficult; uncontrollable yawning, fatigued and a bit nauseated. But today, day 3, it feels like a light switched on in my brain! That light is at the end of the tunnel, meaning I have to give a little more time. If you are truly depressed, this medicine will help you."	17-Feb-15
128300	Phentermine	"I started adipex-p on October 17th 2015... My start weight was 189... I had gained 16 lbs prior to that due to another medication I was on... My doctor recommended trying this because I was completely devastated! I&#039;ve never weighed that much and had always maintained my weight even after having my 2 children... However the same time I started adipex-p I started doing Herbalife shakes (breakfast and lunch) and then ate dinner with my family.. I also got somewhat of a work out in daily due to working at Planet Fitness and can easily walk 10,000   steps daily due to my job description... In 1 month I lost 22 lbs! :-)"	4-Jan-16
142030	Escitalopram	"I started taking lexapro 2 years ago. I have always had bad nerves , but when my daughter graduated high school, I was suffering from the &quot;empty nest syndrome&quot;. Lexapro really helped me alot and the only fall back for me was my weight gain. I went from size 10 to 16 . I am going off from the medicine now and I think that I will do okay and if I ever have to go back on something it would be this. Good Luck!"	14-Dec-08
96075	Sertraline	"Before being prescribed sertraline I would often feel anxious, panicked, and depressed all day, everyday, at work, at home, anywhere I went. On my days off from work I would not get off the couch &amp; sometimes would not even take a shower. I would not say I am an un-motivated person, I graduated from a technical school &amp; work full time with a state licence, so I wanted to feel comfortable with my life.  I was taking alprazolam as needed for panic attacks. Now I don&#039;t even need it. Zoloft has changed my life completely. I feel cool, calm &amp; collected even under pressure. It is great to feel confident enough to live the life I like to live. All these great changes occurred in 2 short months."	21-Jun-12
95913	Sertraline	"I was only on a 25 mg dose for two months. I noticed a very slight mood lift but not much else. I am currently starting a 20 mg dosage of Prozac."	19-Sep-13
140490	Escitalopram	"Lexapro was a miracle drug for me as far as treating my severe health anxiety and PTSD.  It gave me my life back. I can truly say I was my normal self 98% of the time. However it caused me to have extreme muscle tension and headaches. I was even diagnosed with TMJ and was sleeping with a mouthguard at night. Weaning off Lexapro was horrific for me. It took a good 3 months for all the withdrawal symptoms to subside. Thankfully the headaches and stiff jaw got better as well. I&#039;m sad I can&#039;t take Lexapro anymore. It saved my life. I&#039;m about to start on Prozac. We&#039;ll see what happens."	25-Apr-17
64246	Sertraline	"Early days as just starting this due to mirtazapine not working, difficult to rate yet but have high hopes for some relief from daily anxiety,  affecting being unable to socialise and continue with normal life.  Tried CBT but after 20 sessions no better. Your website is helpful with others experiences giving an insight.   Will post again if successful."	4-Jan-17
139060	Phentermine	"Pros:  Not too much stomach discomfort, even with an ulcer and irritable bowel syndrome, alters your craving for food - instead of fries, it&#039;s fruit. I&#039;ve lost 82 pounds so far, with only 20 to go.  Cons: It alters your cravings, not sheds the weight for you. It must accompany a change in lifestyle. I had trouble with increased heart rate and I&#039;m in my 20&#039;s with no heart problems. I was even unable to donate blood because the rate was too high. This stabilizes every time I go off the medicine. It also can make me restless. When my husband and I were both on it, we fought like crazy all the time. I thought I was crazy, but each time we would stop taking it, the fighting would decrease."	5-Jun-09
64055	Sertraline	"I have to be honest, it  has done nothing for me."	4-Feb-17
128251	Phentermine	"I been on this medicine since July of 2015 I started off weighing 462 and now I&#039;m at 343 as of January 2016. My only side affect are slight headache and dry mouth. It requires you to drink plenty of water which is good for your diet. But overall the best I ever came across. I never was a big diet fan so I really never tried to much but I&#039;m glad I have success on my first try"	8-Feb-16
78414	Allegra	"Allegra 24 hour helps my hay fever symptoms. But, this medication dries out my lung tissue to much and makes me cough.  I have been off Allegra for a week and I am still coughing and have LOTS of non infectious mucus coming out of my lungs.  My lungs hurt from coughing.  I am 62 year old female with mild asthma."	15-Jun-12
127646	Phentermine	"I took phentermine for about a month. I lost about 10 pounds.  I had to stop taking this medication. It made me overly anxious, emotional, and I became irritated very quickly. I also experienced hair loss.I did not feel like myself at all.  I feel so much better after I stopped taking this medication. The side effects are not worth it."	22-Apr-17
141651	Escitalopram	"Miracle worker.  Took about six weeks to start fully working and the side effects were not so pleasant at first.  Now taking 20mg daily, I have no side effects and feel great.  During the first few weeks taking it, I would have extremely good moods that almost seemed imaginable and then I would go back to feeling sad.  Then eventually that went away.  One negative about Lexapro is that my stomach isn&#039;t as strong as it was before and a lot of foods bother it.  All I can do is eat healthy and take pro-biotics.  VERY HAPPY with Lexapro."	19-Sep-12
138715	Phentermine	"Excellent."	25-Jan-12
71846	Tramadol	"I have had chronic pain and peripheral neuropathy of the legs and feet for about 4 years, a lovely gift I received just before my 40th birthday that eventually landed me in the hospital in so much pain that my blood pressure was dangerously high.  I had been put on every pain med imaginable, including fentanyl and dilaudid, which made me terribly sick.  Fast forward 4 years and my PCP wanted me to try tramadol in conjunction with my gabapentin 600 mg 3x/day and clonidine 0.1 mg 3x/day.  So far it has been a miracle.  I can finally put on my sneaks and take long walks again, go biking and shop without having to sit on a bench every 10 minutes.  I was prescribed 50 mg of tramadol 2x/day but so far I&#039;ve only taken it once a day and that&#039;s all!"	19-Mar-16
128635	Phentermine	"After experiencing extreme weight gain due to a horrible experience with an imbedded IUD, I was advised by a colleague to try adipex 37.5. I have been taking it since June 1, 2015 and started at 238.2 lbs. Today I weigh 227.4 lbs. it has helped me by suppressing my appetite, increasing my energy and giving me motivation by seeing my weight loss occur so quickly. I walk twice per day and lift weights three times per week. (Arms, legs, abs) I had the dry mouth but lots of water and Biotene help. Insomnia is managed by taking pill no later than 1pm. No rapid heart beat &amp; managing salt intake may help BP. I stay below 1500 mls daily. Will update next month. I&#039;m happy."	14-Jun-15
71893	Tramadol	"I told my physician that I would no longer take Percocet for my chronic back pain. He suggested I try tramadol and assured me it is not a narcotic. I have been talking the tramadol now for a year and although it is no miracle drug it has managed my pain immensely. I can finally sleep at night and function normally. One down side to the drug for me is if I run out and the withdraw starts it is nasty. Be careful you stop the drug abruptly. Good health to all. Rob"	5-Feb-16
140977	Escitalopram	"Not great med. Gained lots of weight. 15mg I was like a zombie. Tired alot and twitching."	23-Mar-16
95999	Sertraline	"This medication has turned me around and I had none of the side effects. I initially requested it from my doctor because, whilst I did not really have any problems, I had a negative outlook despite trying to be positive and I was not enjoying &#039;life&#039; at all.   It has really helped with all this and as an added bonus I feel that I have more energy. I went back to my doctor and said &quot;We hit the nail on the head&quot;. Previously I was looking for the magic vitamin pill to help reduce my stress and increase my energy levels. I tried vitamin B, Iron, and multivitamins to no avail. I no longer feel the need to take any vitamins at all. I&#039;ll continue to take this as needed and have no reservations about taking anti-depressants."	8-Mar-13
141433	Escitalopram	"I was sceptical about taking meds such as this.  However, I had been dealing with so much stress that it had taken a toll on me and life seemed to be falling apart, even though I was always everyone turned to.  My doctor prescribed 10mg once daily and it has been a miracle.  I did cut back to only 5mg a day and take it at night, as it does make me sleepy.  I am so much happier, more energy and a different outlook.  I am 39yrs old and feel like it again.  Only been on the med 3wks and I have nothing negative to say."	22-Dec-13
128903	Phentermine	"The first month from 179 lbs down to 161lbs= 15 mg the whole time.   Now using 30 mg and the first 8 days.  From 161 lbs to 154lbs. It would make me very happy if I can make it the next 3 weeks down to 145 lbs. Then I have prescription for 37mg the last month. If I will make it down to 130 lbs in June, well I can&#039;t ask for more."	21-May-14
64077	Sertraline	"Worked very well for intrusive thoughts OCD for 5 months and then when I missed dosages and tried starting back on it again it stopped working. Other than that I had no problems with Zoloft."	30-Mar-17
138805	Phentermine	"Hi I am a 28 year old female. I started taking this pill 5/9/2010 and went in at a weight of 248lbs. Went back in on 6/21/10 and lost 8 pounds. It seems to be working very well and I just feel anxious sometimes but overall I have a lot of energy. We shall see when I go in next month and I&#039;m also on a 1200 calorie diet which is working well for me along with exercise."	27-Jun-10
95793	Sertraline	"I was taking Lexapro 10mg then upped to 20mg for the past 5 years. In the beginning it was great, I felt great, no anxiety or depression.  But for the past two years my everyday life started to become a struggle. I became upset easily, I cried all the time, it was horrible.  So my Dr and I decided that maybe the Lexapro had pooped out and to try a different antidepressant. So I began sertraline 50mgs. I&#039;ve had no side effects except for some heartburn right after taking. So I began Prilosec to counteract this. I feel good. No anxiety and I can feel my depression lifting. I sleep fine no problems there. But I do take 25mgs of Vistaril at night so I&#039;m sure that helps. "	18-Feb-14
72197	Tramadol	"Very little effect on pain."	25-May-14
64789	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve always experienced social anxiety growing up. I thought this was normal but it became clear to me during college that I shouldn&#039;t be feeling so shy all the time. I was afraid to be myself. I was constantly going back and forth between anxiety and depression for years. I tried meditation, yoga, running, a different diet... But nothing seemed to be working good enough! Enough was enough! I researched zoloft for a few weeks and finally decided to try it out. WOAH! Other than the initial side effects such as decreased appetite and restlessness, this medication changed my life!!! I feel very comfortable talking to people in social settings.. I could finally be myself! The biggest thing is being patient--- it works!!!!! Good luck everyone!"	23-Jun-15
141810	Escitalopram	"Thank goodness for this medication.  I only wish I had started it earlier, before my GAD, low confidence, and suspicions hurt my marriage.  This medicine helps, even though all the therapy in the world did not touch my feelings.  I started with 5mg and felt a little improvement right away.  Went to 10mg after a particularly bad day and what a relief.  Side effects are minor so far."	23-Nov-10
140701	Escitalopram	"This is about my boyfriend who is currently taking this med. He is acting differently sometimes acting like he doesn&#039;t care about anything. He got rashes on some of his body. He is not the same. I&#039;m trying to talk him into trying something else. I don&#039;t like the side effects I&#039;m seeing in him. He&#039;s still depressed so it&#039;s not really helping him. He&#039;s like dr. Jekyl &amp; Hyde. He  will snap 1 minute then the next minute he&#039;s talking very nice as if nothing happened or he didn&#039;t remember saying anything mean. It&#039;s been a roller coaster I think I would rather have him not on anything or prescribed medical marijuana for his anxiety &amp; to help him relax. I don&#039;t know what the right answer is. Maybe we will find something in the near future to help."	19-Oct-16
71758	Tramadol	"Took for short term (5 weeks) after double knee replacement. I took it as directed two 50mg tablets twice daily.  When I tried to discontinue this drug I had horrible withdrawal symptoms.  I was not warned that it had a dependency potential and it was given to me billed as much safer then Hydrocodone as far as addiction. Heads up if you are going to take this medication for very long."	22-Oct-16
63992	Sertraline	"I have taken a wide selection on antidepressant drugs from imipramine, prozac, paxil, and Effexor to name a few. Prozac and Effexor being two of the worst drugs. Prozac I had chronic diarrhea and no therapeutic benefit. Effexor had no therapeutic value and left me completely sexually impotent. Sertraline has helped with my racing thoughts and depression with little or no noticeable side effects. My experiences may not be typical for everyone, but it is the best antidepressant I have found."	14-Jun-17
96450	Sertraline	"I started using Zoloft about 2 months ago for stress and anxiety. I have a teenager and we fought constantly, I would fly off at him for back talking and we were both miserable. Since taking Zoloft we get along so much better and I am not as stressed. I also have a touch of OCD, I was always cleaning and stressing about everything in the house not being like it should, now I am not bothered if something is out of place or not cleaned. I spend time with my 2 kids instead of cleaning house. I am taking 50mg and I love it. My sex drive hasn&#039;t been affected, my appetite decreased for about 2 weeks but it&#039;s okay now. I recommend this medication to anyone who feels they need something to help with stress."	20-May-09
128311	Phentermine	"I&#039;ve read nothing but good positive reviews on fastin so I purchased a bottle and started taking mine today! I can&#039;t wait to see my results!"	29-Dec-15
140927	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve been taking lexapro for two months now for depression and anxiety. The first 3-4 weeks I took 10mg and I felt amazing. I had loads of energy and actually felt social for once. After those 3-4 weeks however the happy feeling faded and I was plagued with fatigue and unable to get anything done. I couldn&#039;t keep my eyes open in class or to study. So I decided to wean off of it and am now taking 5mg every other day. I still get the great feeling for about 20 after taking it, and then I feel fairly, but not as tired as I was on 10mg, and unenthused by anything. I&#039;m not sure if I want to keep taking it or not."	19-Dec-15
64132	Sertraline	"I have been on Zoloft for 7 months now and it has really improved my life. The first few weeks were absolutely BRUTAL. Couldn&#039;t focus, super dizzy, nausea, more depressed, etc. However, I stuck with it and after about a month, the depression started to get much better. Of course, I still have my days (who doesn&#039;t?) but I would highly recommend trying Zoloft if you can get through the first few weeks. It truly has changed my life for the better."	10-Apr-17
128041	Phentermine	"UPDATE:   I started taking phentermine 37.5 mg. on July 19th weighing 177lbs, today is July 30th and I weigh 169lbs. so I&#039;m down 8lbs. I don&#039;t take the medicine everyday sometimes I skip 1 or 2 days &amp; I only take 1/2 a pill to cut down on the side effects plus I don&#039;t want my body becoming dependent on this because I won&#039;t be on it long. I&#039;m happy with my loss &amp; sure it could be more but I&#039;m trying to do this the right way as safe as possible. Will give you another update when I reach my 1st goal of losing 20lbs."	31-Jul-16
64797	Sertraline	"Hi all. As a summary, please continue using your meds and keep in touch with your doctor. I don&#039;t know your personal case but it helped me and I feel better than before I had symptoms.   The first 4 months were awful feeling weak, victim. Thanks to my wife&#039;s support I continued. 5-7 months things seemed to bother me less and less. I started focusing on solutions rather than problems. 8-10 months(now) I feel powerful and can stand against the issues and people that bothers me. Keep in mind again, everybody is different and this med may not be your cure. It helped me and I helped myself for getting better. I gave 8 out of 10 because of initial side effects. For me it turned out that it is worth."	7-Aug-15
72404	Tramadol	"I have been taking tramadol for over 11 years for RLS and while I think it works pretty well for my legs, I feel I have to take more than prescribed to get the same amount of relief that I did when I began the medication.  I have not told my doctor for fear that she will take me off the medicine.  The withdrawal symptoms are horrendous. My legs are 10 times worse when I am coming off tramadol.  I get involuntary spasms in both my arms and legs and am extremely moody.  It is near impossible for me to sleep without the tramadol.  I am not trying to scare anyone away from taking it because I know it has worked wonders for a lot of other people. "	9-Dec-10
141697	Escitalopram	"Was given Lexapro for mild depression, during the 18months I was on it I suffered hot flushes, constant tiredness, severe carbohydrate craving with a weight gain of approximately 2kg per month, all in the upper body, especially the abdominal region. No sexual desire and complete apathy. My GP put this down to depression and kept increasing the dosage. My family intervened when my liver bloods started to be abnormal. I came off Lexapro from 20mg per day over a 2 month period. Since being off it, I feel amazing, 8 hours sleep is sufficient, whereas on Lexapro I was sleeping up to 14 hrs daily and still constantly tired. The abdominal weight gain has vanished without any change in my routine and most importantly the hot flushes are gone. 32yr female."	13-Nov-11
64245	Sertraline	"I was a little apprehensive at first but glad I started on this. I was feeling very low and also anxious about events and going out etc. But mostly, it was feeling low that got me to visit the doctor.    The first day on 50mg I felt an immediate high and felt like smiling all the time! It was very strange but I still felt myself, just happier. Then from then it tapered off to feeling very low again at the end of the first week. This lasted two days and I considered making an appointment as it worried me. However, it picked up again and I&#039;ve felt great since. Almost 4 weeks now on 50mg and the doctor has prescribed me with 100mg to start which I feel fine about. I did have experience headaches and a little nausea but its worth it."	14-Nov-16
97171	Ambien	"I have been taking Ambien since it was   released to the public. I only use it occasionally. Sometimes I have a period of several days where going or staying asleep is a problem, then no need for weeks. I have never had any after or side effects from taking Ambien. I feel it is, for me and my condition, the best medication on the market."	2-Jun-12
72010	Tramadol	"Tramadol works great for my back pain doing the day when I&#039;m working. It has worked great for me for over 10yrs and it keeps my stress levels down. Things that I normally would let bother me don&#039;t bother me."	9-Sep-15
64864	Sertraline	"I am a 45 year old female and have had mild to moderate anxiety for most of my adult life.  I lived with it for years and tried different medications on and off when my level of anxiety increased.  I also tried yoga, meditation, exercise and counselling.  A year ago, a new doctor prescribed 100mg Zoloft 1x/day.  It took about a month for me to feel a difference, but Zoloft has given me the most &quot;normal&quot; feeling of any drug I ever tried.  I do not have sexual side effects, as I did with other antidepressants nor do I feel numb or sleepy throughout the day.  I have gained some weight (15 pounds) over the past year, but I can&#039;t really attribute it just to Zoloft."	23-Apr-15
34176	Tramadol	"This drug did absolutely nothing for the level of pain I&#039;ve been experiencing. The doctor&#039;s &quot;group&quot; would not allow him to prescribe anything stronger or more effective. This unfortunately is not the magic bullet for chronic pain."	6-May-09
138725	Phentermine	"I have been using phentermine since the middle of last year. My starting weight was 235 and I dropped down to 190 at best. My goal weight is 140 (I don&#039;t want to be too thin). I look so much better in my clothes and can actually wear a size 12. I&#039;ve struggled with weight for a very long time and this seems to be the only thing that actually produces results...kudos! P.S.: I do recommend though that you use it then don&#039;t use it for some days that way it can work to it&#039;s full potential and your body won&#039;t get so used to it."	16-Jul-11
64278	Sertraline	"I have been through a very traumatic abusive marriage for 6 years and finally got away from the abuse. I took Zoloft a few years ago during the marriage due to intense panic attacks. But after the divorce I got off of it thinking I didn&#039;t need it anymore. Well a couple months ago I felt my anxiety creeping back and have several panic attacks. I went to my doctor and he stated me on 50mg of Zoloft for the anxiety. I was hoping it would be an immediate relief but then remembered it takes at least two weeks to start making you feel better. Today, it will be 8 days that I have been on it. Take it every night before I go to bed. Doctor prescribed me low dose of Xanax to prevent panic attacks until Zoloft kicks in. day 8, I&#039;m finally feeling better"	9-Nov-16
141161	Escitalopram	"Works great for GAD.  I fought my feelings for years and just toughed it out.  I found myself drinking to ease my symptoms.  The drinking helped turn my brain off for the night, but the feelings just came back the next day.  Finally told my doctor about my symptoms and was prescribed Lexapro.  Within 48 hours the anxiety was dramatically reduced, no excessive sweating, mind racing, etc.  This drug is a god send.  10 mg works best for me, tried 20 but couldn&#039;t feel the difference.  Now just have to deal with the drinking."	31-Aug-15
71677	Tramadol	"I was prescribed Tramadol because I couldn&#039;t tolerate other pain meds with codeine or Tylenol. Tramadol is great until you run out.  I have taken this drug for approximately 7 years now. I wish I&#039;d never started it. It&#039;s just been a roller coaster for me it helps me feel better, but does zero for the pain &amp; then you build a tolerance up &amp; it just gets worse from there.  I&#039;ve had withdrawals from this a few times. I&#039;ve never had such horrible withdrawals as with this med, sneezing, coughing, hot, cold, chills, sweats, restless, depressed &amp; irritable to name a few with lethargy.  I am due for a refill tomorrow I&#039;m not picking it up. It&#039;s really hard right now, but going through this agony isn&#039;t an option again."	29-Mar-17
139107	Phentermine	"Love it."	23-Jan-09
140815	Escitalopram	"Started on Cipralex (escitalopram) in January. Starting off, had a few side effects of nervousness, sweating at night and my vision was somewhat fuzzy sometimes, but all subsided within 1 week or 2. For the most part, my anxiety/depression decreased but it made me super tired, all i wanted to do was sleep. I would get 6-8hrs of sleep a night, but still feel exhausted waking up in the morning and tired throughout the day. This continued for about 2 months so my doc recommended I switch to Pristiq. I had 0 side effects switching and I found I had much more energy. I still slept great at night, and not as drowsy throughout the days."	15-Jun-16
141561	Escitalopram	"I have had depression my entire life. I thought it was normal. I tried everything to feel better: meditation, endless job changes. Everything failed. Then my doctor got me onto Lexapro. I am on 40mg per day. At 38 my life finally began. It hit a re-set in my identity. Same memories with a new personality. This product (for me at least), is an absolute God-send. I am at last able to be happy."	25-May-13
127738	Phentermine	"After I gave birth to my daughter I went back to my pre-baby weight until I got the birth control implant in my arm and I gain close to 70 pounds in a year. I started Phentermine in September and its now March and I have lost 75 pounds. I a busy mother so I exercise when I can which is not often. I do portion control and I only drink water. This pill gave me my old life back."	16-Mar-17
96411	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve only been on this for 4 days now and so far I&#039;ve had nothing but side effects. Although it&#039;s partially my fault. My doctor never warned me about iburophen or caffeine. I had a headache so I took something for it and it just made the effects so much worse. I then took an energy sports drink before the gym and overdosed on caffeine. I was awake for 64hrs before finally getting any sleep and that only lasted 4 hours. But I must say I was a lot more alert, my eyes were tired but my brain wasn&#039;t. Other side effects I&#039;ve had are severe shakiness, dry mouth, nausea, diarrhea, loss in appetite, yawning, teeth grinding, ear popping. I&#039;m going to stick with it to see the outcome."	27-Jan-11
97151	Ambien	"Periodically, I take Ambien.  I have tried other sleep aids, Lunesta, Seroquel and others. However Ambiem is the one sleep prescription that allows me a good nights sleep and wake up without a drugged feeling.  I am then ready to &#039;take on the world&#039;.  Ambien is great and I would definitely recommend it."	3-Jan-11
139007	Phentermine	"I have been using Phentermine for a year now. My regular weight was 186-4lbs maybe and now my weight is 137lbs. I never thought that I could be this small and I love it. I feel wonderful because now I can fit and look in clothes I never thought possible."	9-Jul-09
72005	Tramadol	"When I was prescribed Tramadol for abdominal pain, little did I know about the Bonus effects.  I was able to lose 20lbs in 3 months (less appetite).   My mood became so good and I got my joy of life back. I took 50mg daily.  I felt less anxious and depressed. Mostly, I cared less about what people think of me. I started to swim and hike. My mom, who is against pills, said &quot; you changed so much whatever that you do, keep doing it&quot;. I&#039;m a 45 yo male."	23-Sep-15
71695	Tramadol	"Did not work on my pain"	29-May-17
128882	Phentermine	"UPDATE I started phentermine 1 month ago and have gone down from 250lbs to 229lbs. I exercise 3-4 times a week for an hr usually 25min of T25 and 35 mins or more walking/running my cardio has gotten much better since I started and I can admit I think I&#039;ve become a workout junky. If I don&#039;t exercise for a day or two I feel guilty. Anyhow I&#039;ve also changed my diet completely. I&#039;m on the low carbs diet and it is&#039;nt so bad one cheat day which is Sunday and I count calories also I still eat bread but only 100% wheat bread hopefully once I reach my goal weight which is 139lbs I can keep my exercise and WEIGHT."	23-Jun-14
71909	Tramadol	"Very affective for anxiety, but made me so tired I had to switch."	4-Jan-16
72058	Tramadol	"I have been on Tramadol 50mg for a number of years due to RLS, I take two at night only.    It now is a controlled drug, to which only half the amount is prescribed."	3-May-15
141944	Escitalopram	"I have been on Lexapro for over 4 yrs after going into a deep depression after several traumatic life experiences. I am very grateful for Lexapro and my therapist (who helps me with coping techniques.) After being on Lexapro my family has told me they are not sure how to take the new me. When I was upset I would have anxiety attacks and black out. When I was angry I was uncontrollable sometimes even physical with my love ones. The sad part is I did not even know they were happening or happened until they told me. I wish I had gotten help sooner but now I am grateful and blessed for Lexapro and therapy. Every medicine is not right for everyone so you need to find the one that fits you along with therapy."	6-Nov-09
128284	Phentermine	"I have been taking Phentermine for 20 days now and I have never felt better! I am 21 years old I started out at 289 Lbs and is of today I&#039;m 274 lb with that being said I have done a total life change. I quit eating fast food, and any sweets, no soda or energy drinks, and the hardest one for me is I have dropped from drinking around 30 beers a week to my limit or 2 a week. It has been hard but I know it is totally worth it! The only side effect I have seen is my blood pressure seems to by high for the first couple hours I take it."	14-Jan-16
71912	Tramadol	"I have had major health issues all year. 3 bulging discs in my neck. Got the pain somewhat masked with multiple rounds of injections, and finally burning the nerve endings in my neck so that I am no longer waking every morning in pain. I subsequently tore a ligament in my shoulder and am now having to start physical therapy and see an orthopedic doctor. I have been taking muscle relaxers as well as Hydrocodone .  Having constant pain issues for so long has made me feel depressed, all I want to do is work and sleep. Today I went to my medicine pantry and pulled out a bottle of Tramadol that I had been prescribed previously. I took one and within an hour the fog lifted and I feel 100% better! Will be taking this daily now"	29-Dec-15
96301	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been on Zoloft (generic) for a few weeks now. I&#039;m on a low dose (25mg) to get me started. I haven&#039;t noticed much of a lift in my mood, in fact I tend to get sad more easily, but I have fewer headaches, which used to be a big problem for me. Also I&#039;ve noticed it makes me really tired so I take it at night to help me sleep."	12-Aug-10
141929	Escitalopram	"I started taking Lexapro in April this year for anxiety/OCD and it did help a lot and I was able to function again. The two main side effects were weird vivid dreams and I have gained about 20 lbs which I cannot stand so I&#039;m now weaning myself off.  I&#039;ve been off for about 1 week and my mood has been so up and down. Very irritable. Also, have been having the weird brain zaps but now they are wearing off after about a week."	28-Dec-09
97136	Ambien	"Ambien works well for me, I take 5 mg. Some nights if husband is snoring very loud I need 10 mg. I take it only when needed, like traveling or maybe twice a month. My problem is the next night I will not sleep without Ambien I have to have some wine to relax me, then I&#039;ll sleep, next night I am fine."	24-Jun-11
141722	Escitalopram	"I am 21 and was recently on this medicine for 4 months. I was prescribed Lexapro, it helped in more ways than one.  I&#039;ve always dealt with daily anxiety, but I had never known any other way.  A single worry could ruin the entire day.  While on Lexapro, it raised my emotional state to where it needed to be and also suppressed my anxiety. It was nice to be giddy and to care about people again.  No weight gain/loss to be noted, but it made me very tired and disrupted my sleep.  Woke up about 3 times a night compared to my usual zero, and my dreams were vivid and disturbing.  Don&#039;t go off cold turkey, even if your mood stays positive, there are physical withdrawals such as hand-eye coordination off, headaches, shakiness, clumsiness. Good luck!"	11-Feb-12
214542	Escitalopram	"Wasn&#039;t sleeping well and was having career-related anxiety.  I went to my PCP and he put me on Ambien and Lexapro.  I was very concerned about effect Lexapro would have on me, but I went ahead and started it.  First day I was a little tingly but no other immediate physical response.  The next morning I woke up retching/dry heaving.  I spent the whole day having hot and cold spells.  My ears were burning.  My head felt congested but without any sinus issues.  I was severely agitated/restless.  I couldn&#039;t sit still.  Felt sick all day.  I took the pill again the second morning (yesterday), but today woke up retching again.  Still very restless with some twitching of arms and legs.  Didn&#039;t take the medicine again today."	13-Nov-17
71629	Tramadol	"I have excruciating pain due to Psoriatic Arthritis (hip joints) and Recurring Painful Sciatica due to my Lumbar issues (herniated L2-3; bulged L3-4, L4-5, L5-S1,; borderline stenosis L2-3; 5mm perineural cyst L3-4). My PC sent me to a pain management specialist, who prescribed me to BUTRAN skin patch 5 micro-gram which never worked to reduce pain.  The instruction was to start TRAMADOL-HCL 50mg per day, 7 days after Butran. &quot; Only 4 days&quot;  into TRAMADOL, I woke up in the morning with stabbing pain in my right eye. My upper right eyelid was warm to the touch with tears in it. In the mirror, it was reddish color and swelled up. Called the doctor immediately. Without reducing it actually increased pain."	25-Oct-17
138776	Phentermine	"I am a 27 year old 5&#039;2 women. My weight started at 242lbs on March 1st. I lost 8lbs in a month teaching myself how to eat right. I just went to the doctor on April 21st and he gave me Adipex for 30 days. I started taking it on the 22nd and today is the 25th and I have lost 7lbs in 4 days. I do have dry mouth, nausea, headache at night and have trouble sleeping. I don&#039;t have that burst of energy I hear so many talk about. I have not started working out yet, but tonight I will start that. I too do not crave sweets and I also am a huge coke drinker and I haven&#039;t wanted one since I started. All I want is water and that&#039;s a good thing. This is my first time taking Adipex and so far I am very happy with it."	25-Apr-11
128599	Phentermine	"Have been on phenomine 30MG now for the past 4 days and have lost 4 lbs. I have been having dry mouth. my starting weight was 270lbs. I&#039;ll post an update in 21days."	25-May-15
64189	Sertraline	"My depression and anxiety left me house bound and unable to pull myself out of bed, incapable of getting into the shower and basic everyday tasks. I&#039;m 1 week into my Zoloft prescription and feeling lows and peaks of the medication. Today is tough which is why I found this site to see how you all feel. Does anyone feel like huge surge of depression? I don&#039;t understand the overwhelming feelings today out of the blue?"	7-Mar-17
139176	Phentermine	"I&#039;m 5&#039;4 and topped the scales at 265lbs.  I started taking Adipex and it really has helped me out alot.  I started taking it 5 weeks ago and now I weigh 225lbs.  I have more energy and my clothes are beginning to fit me better.   I actually went from a size 20 to a 18.  I&#039;m excited and ready to lose the rest of my the weight."	11-Sep-08
127790	Phentermine	"After a bad break up &amp; a hard time at work, put on 40 pounds over 7 months but then I went from 314# to 219# over 2 years. Then things got crazy again and I went from 219 to 259 on 2/17/17 when I got weighed at the dr&#039;s office. He knew how hard I worked to drop those original 96 pounds &amp; wanted to get me back on track. Started Phentermine 37.5 on 2/20, it has been 5 days &amp; I&#039;m down 8.6 pounds. Suppresses my appetite, don&#039;t want to snack or crave junk food. I have to literally make myself eat -- unfamiliar territory after my gluttony these last 7 months! Drinking 128 oz  of water a day. Meals are lean &amp; around 800 calories. Side effects: Insomnia &amp; mild constipation. Hoping it continues this way -- would love to drop 30 pounds at my 1 month mark!"	25-Feb-17
128022	Phentermine	"I have been on Phentermine 30mg for 28 days as of today I have lost 20lbs. Only side effect I&#039;m having is constipation. So with that being said I&#039;m very happy with outcome.. Exciting to see what the next month on them will bring since I can only get Rx for 3 months on then 3 off.

96257	Sertraline	"I have been taking this medicine for a little over 2mths and I have notice a big difference in my behavior. I laugh a lot more now and talk in a group more and today I was able to go shopping to two different stores and sign up for the gym all by myself and not feel like everyone is talking or staring at me. I even was able to talk to people in the store and not feel funny. I hope this lasts because I kind of like getting out by myself although I still have to push myself to do things, overall I am thankful for this medicine."	28-Feb-12
72587	Tramadol	"I have arthritis in most joints and back and neck pain.  I have used Tramadol for 2 years now. It was life changing in the way it relieved pain without nasty side effects of  hydrocodone (I got very irritable when it wore off). Seems to be taking higher dosage for less relief but still would rather continue the tramadol and use something for breakthrough pain on physical work days. If you experience nausea try a lower dose and work up to more. Stick with it,  the nausea went away for me. When I forget a day or so and go back to it I sometimes get nausea again."	13-Sep-10
96412	Sertraline	"Female, 23, anxiety disorder. I have been on this medication for almost a year. I have dealt with anxiety my whole life and finally when I was having trouble going to school and work I turned to Zoloft. It has improved my quality of life. I have had the dose increased from 25 to 50 to 75. Side effects I have felt include: loss of appetite, dizziness, and mood swings. All side effects happened with start and increase of medicine and subside after getting used to it. I still have breakdowns sometimes but not as often. "	18-Jan-11
138782	Phentermine	"I&#039;m the same user from 3/18 post, I started on 1/7/11 at 332.6lbs. I took 30mg for 60 days. I got another script for 60 days from my doctor. I changed all my eating habits from the first day and started to exercise. I decided to take a break for 10 days to get it out of my system before starting the new script. I noticed no side effects of stopping. I stuck with the diet and upped the exercise just a little. I still lost 3lbs that week! The week before, still on pills, I only lost 1.8lbs. I decided to stop taking it all together. I&#039;m down to 295lbs. You must change your diet and exercise."	25-Mar-11

64768	Sertraline	"Hello all! I started zoloft 4 years ago (at age 22) for GAD/panic. The first 3/5 weeks I wanted to die from the side effects- extreme nausea, lack of appitite (lost 15 lbs on my 125lb frame) cold sweats, anxiety increase,  insomnia,  and feeling overall HOPELESS! I started on 50 mg and increased to a therapeutic level of 100mg. Over the last 4 years I have been on top of the world traveling, camping, building a home and have slowly decreased my zoloft to 12.5mg a day for the past year. 3 weeks ago I got lazy about taking my medicine and didn&#039;t take it for 3 or 4 days in a row, then remembered and started taking it again. 2 days later it was like I was starting from square 1(all the same effects) Don&#039;t fix what isn&#039;t broken-don&#039;t stop zoloft"	14-Aug-15

96502	Sertraline	"For the past 5 years I have been suffering from Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). It affected my life in all aspects. I finally found a solution to my disorder.

141596	Escitalopram	"I switched from Lexapro to the generic escitalopram one month ago (since the generic is cheaper) and it was a disaster. I felt like I was no longer on medication: severe anxiety attacks, anger, depression, difficulty getting out of bed in the morning. I tried to wait it out for 1 month and then gave up and went back to Lexapro because my personal and professional relationships were being affected while I was on the generic escitalopram."	12-Mar-13
97011	Ambien	"I have been taking Ambien every night for a over 20 years. I am a nurse and it&#039;s very difficult to work swing shift and teach yourself to sleep whenever ..esp if you suffer from insomnia. I have had insomnia since a child, probably sleep walking. Sleep eating prior to taking the medicine. Now that I have it ..my life has improved 200 percent .No one can imaging how disturbing it is to lie in bed for 8 hours wide awake ...knowing you have work soon. When I first took it, I was groggy in the morning ..but now as long as I get 8 hours I wake up feeling awake and amazing ..never grew a tolerance for it. Always works. I will say when I had children under 5 ..I would never take it ...not safe ..when you are caring for others .this med saved me."	1-Feb-15

64101	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been on 50 mg of Zoloft for 5 days. Believe it or not I feel a little better already. I got up this morning and cleaned my entire house. My mood is better with my kids and people around me. I&#039;m not where I want to be but it&#039;s still early. My only complaint is severe gas. I can&#039;t seem to make it stop no matter what I try ( beano, gas x) but I&#039;m gonna keep going for now. It feels good not having to fight with your own brain everyday to &quot;try&quot; to be or &quot;act&quot; happy. Good luck to everyone. :)"	6-May-17

The older I get, the harder it is to try to lose weight it seems. My Dr. put me on Phentermine 37.5 last week. As of that appointment on 5/25 my starting weight was 260lb. As of 6/2, my current weight is 252lb. it&#039;s a huge challenge to try to eat as my appetite is GONE this first week.

141552	Escitalopram	"I started taking escitalopram at 5mg for two weeks because I was nervous about the side effects, but I didn&#039;t get any. Then I went to 10mg and still no side effects. I have been on 10mg for almost three weeks now and do notice a small difference.  I don&#039;t get as upset about the little things that would bother me and am able to let things go a little easier. I am still hoping that it kicks in a bit more, so we&#039;ll see."	18-Jun-13
138660	Phentermine	"My sister-in-law has been on it for 6 months and I cannot believe how much weight she has lost.  However, she has to work really hard at it and exercises like the energizer bunny, and has changed her eating. However, she seems to still have her glasses of wine and still keeps off the weight. Today is my first day using the pill and already I didn&#039;t realize it was 1:00pm already, and hadn&#039;t wanted lunch. I want to lose about 20 lbs, but at a stand still at the moment.  Diet and exercise was not working. I will report back in a month with hopefully great results."	1-Sep-11

I&#039;ve been on 10mg for the past month  but I noticed every time I have drinks,  the next  day I have nasty p&acirc;nic attacks. They are awful.  Its been only a month.  Does it get better after 2 months.  I like this medicine, I feel alive again. I wanna jump out of my bed and go to the gym at 6am like before! I haven&#039;t felt like this in a year! Before all I wanted to do was sleep and stay attached to my bed.    I love this med but i think I&#039;ll need to upper the dose for my anxiety.  :&#039;("	29-Feb-16

140629	Escitalopram	"I have only been taking Lexapro for about 3-4 weeks but it seems to work for me so far. I started this medicine due to very bad panic attacks and depression. I have only had one very minor panic attack since and it was within the first few days of taking it. I find it a lot easier to calm myself down now and my panic attacks don&#039;t spiral. I used to have crying episodes that would last hours and I have not cried once since I started Lexapro. Side effects- I have had some headaches and muscle tension and I can feel quite dizzy and foggy sometimes but as long as it keeps my panic attacks away I really don&#039;t mind. I felt nauseous the first few days but it went away quickly."	12-Dec-16
64794	Sertraline	"The Dr. prescribed this med after I developed a tolerance to Prozac after 15 wonderful years.  I started at 25 mg. They always say to give it a few weeks to see if it is working.  After 2 months he increased the dosage to 50 mg. which still did not work.  Then after an increase to 100 mg. for a few months, he finally believed it was not working for me.  He started me on Effexor, which took another 6 months of gradually increasing dosage to actually kick in.  Please do not give up.  After over a year of living a nightmare and feeling suicidal every single day, I&#039;m now back to normal, almost every day."	16-Jun-15

I am a very active person and eat great. First couple days I did have headaches, which only lasted 2-3 days now I have had none.  The boost of energy is nice. I do experience some dry mouth, thankfully I LOVE  water! I&#039;ll post in another month  hopefully I will be under 200 pounds!"	6-Jul-17
204081	Escitalopram	"This medication is my miracle. The only reason I rated 9 instead of 10 was due to initial 3 day side effects. It was bad but if you can power through its worth it. Side effects were increased restlessness, sweating, mild nausea, feeling faint when standing up, tight headache, and no appetite. After 3 days all of this was gone except sweaty palms and slightly decreased appetite and in only those couple of days I felt like a new person. My obsessive thoughts slowed drastically and became more rational and overall I was so much happier and more positive. It was almost like a light switch because it was so bad I was considering going to the hospital for help and I&#039;m only on 10mg. Also morning is best to take it."	21-Mar-14
95838	Sertraline	"At first I was reluctant to take a pill even though I had been diagnosed with major depression.  My family talked me into taking this medication. I am on my third week of taking Zoloft. The first week my doctor started me on 50mg.  The first few days I felt awful but stuck with the medication. I had not felt much relief in my depression and anxiety on 50mg so my psych doc put me on 100mg after two weeks.  I am on day 4 taking 100mg sertraline and have already started to notice a difference in my mood.  I am less anxious and worry much less at work.  I am also beginning to venture out of the house more than I used to.  The only side effects I&#039;ve had on sertraline are mild headache, diarrhea, and decrease in sexual performance."	22-Dec-13

97291	Ambien	"I have been taking Ambien for more years than I can count due to insomnia and nightmares.  I have experienced the &quot;sleep walking&quot; activities, mostly repetitive conversations and eating which have been benign and harmless.  Fortunately, I have family that is up later than me so they keep me from doing anything too outrageous.  Sometimes I have a vague memory of my activities if my husband brings it to my attention, but if I am particularly stressed or anxious the side effects are amplified and my memory is gone.  As for morning grogginess, a shower usually perks me up."	14-Apr-10

64779	Sertraline	"I have suffered from MDD most of my life undiagnosed and untreated, and now in my thirties finally decided to see if dysfunctional patterns in my life might not all be character related. I was diagnosed with MDD quickly and immediately prescribed Sertraline, and it worked so well so quickly my doctor and I thought it was a placebo effect. I have gone on and off the meds over the last six months just to see what other factors are affecting me, and can say without equivocation, these meds have been completely life altering. My doctor helped me understand that mental illness is as real as diabetes. Diabetics can make huge health improvements through lifestyle and still require insulin be cause of a physical malfunction. So too with Depression."	3-Jul-15
97045	Ambien	"Ambien CR 12.5 works for me, but, for some reason I can&#039;t take the generic.  Negates my anti-depressant (doctor has tried me on different anit-depressants &amp; does it on all of them.)  Has anyone else had this problem?  Very weird."	1-Nov-13
128679	Phentermine	"Phentermine was the ONLY prescribed weight loss pill that actually worked for me. Before I started the program I had a complete physical by by doctor. When she prescribed this medicine to me, I also decided to change my eating habits. I kicked the sodas, sugars (sweets), fried foods and other junk. I partnered with Diet2Go and order all of my pre-measured food from them. Once my food arrived, I then started taking Phentermine. I only drank pure water with lemon juice - NO SUGAR. I made sure I started taking the medication the same time each morning (9:00 a.m.), ate breakfast, lunch and dinner all in sync, everyday! By the end of the month (30 days to be exact) I went back to my doctor for monitoring - lost 18 lbs in 30 days! It works."	9-May-15

But after about 5 days, all of that subsided.  I only eat chicken, turkey, and white fish, veggies and fruit while working out for at least an hour, 4 days per week.  After a cup of black coffee in the morning, the only other drink all day is water.  I hope the progress continues.....goal is to lose 40 lbs and keep it off this time!"	7-Aug-15
141605	Escitalopram	"I started 5 mg two days ago and I feel better already. No more sweaty palms or burning forehead due to high anxiety! I take it in the morning so I am able to sleep at night. I tried Zoloft and Celexa and could not take either one for more than two days! Horrific side effects for me! I pray each day gets better and better! This is my first time taking an antidepressant. I highly recommend for people with anxiety! Good luck"	14-Feb-13
72520	Tramadol	"Well, very few side effects for me, but also very little pain relief.  I&#039;ve been prescribed this several times to treat my chronic pain symptoms as well as a couple of acute things (injuries).  It was basically for the purpose of being able to function. "	6-Apr-10

It ended up giving me pancreatitis and was in the hospital for 4 days. After that another month went by and my doctor proscribed me phenamine and lost tons of weight! I got off for a month and he proscribed it to me for another month. I&#039;m on my second day of the second round 30 day ct. and I&#039;ve lost 2 lbs in 2 days. Over all it&#039;s a good product.

Then in November I had a partial hysterectomy. And gained back what I had lost in 2 months. That sucked. So today I went to my primary care Dr and asked for adipex...most drs won&#039;t prescribe it but she agreed I needed to lose weight. I&#039;ve taken phentermine before in my 20s with great results. Wish me luck on losing! I&#039;ll update again in a week."	12-Jan-16

Initially wary that these would be the same or worse. But 4 weeks into treatment. I really am back to my old self, Happy to enjoy life rather than being anxious all of the time. What&#039;s more, my work performance has improved, relationships are much more fulfilling for me and them. I exercise more, eat healthily, and generally my cognition is calm and clear.  Few side affects.. Slight sleep disturbances, jaw clenching, and thirst...all now reduced and are easy to live with considering the benefits."	9-May-15
64005	Sertraline	"Never taken any Antidepressants before. Had my first panic attack about a month ago and felt very down. Had another panic attack 2 days later. Felt as low and desperately sad as I ever have in my life. Came on very suddenly. Went to the doctor and he prescribed me 50mg of Sertraline.  First week was awful! Anxiety and depression even worse! Unlike a lot of you, I was terribly constipated. Sleep was disrupted but bearable. Appetite completely gone. No suicidal thoughts but felt so sad and low. However, having reading all your feedback I decided to stick with it. I am now on day 12 (I&#039;m aware it takes a while to &quot;kick in&quot;) and for the first time today don&#039;t feel quite so bad. Anxiety gone... Will stick with it for now..."	12-May-17
71615	Tramadol	"I have been on this medication for about 4 years due to Ankylosing spondylitis and I find it pretty effective.  However, I have found that this medication caused unexpected side effects.  It was pointed out to me that shortly after taking a dose, I undertake massive projects that I normally wouldn&#039;t, become extremely talkative, insomnia and motivation that wasn&#039;t there originally.  I was diagnosed as being bipolar a year ago and these are all symptoms of the &quot;hypermania&quot; aspect of Bipolar disorder.  My doctor has found that Ultram put me in a &quot;manic state&quot; and when the medication begins to wear off I tend to become anxious and agitated.  There are studies reflecting this online. I would not recommend this medication if you are bipolar."	1-Dec-17

I would recommend this for anyone having trouble lossing weight on their own. Yes you will get dry mouth I always bring a bottle of water with me and it helps . I have lost my taste for most carbs and my appetite has shrunk. I look forward to doctors appointments the more I loss the lower my blood pressure goes my other goal is to get off blood pressure meds. Go back to doctors 12/2015 I&#039;m hoping for big numbers.

I went from 216 to 201 in 3 weeks.  I would say yes, phentermine definitely works to curb my appetite.  My next weigh in is March 1, 2014.  I hope to be under 200 (fingers crossed).  I don&#039;t want to get my hopes up since I&#039;ve already lost &quot;a lot&quot; for the first month according to my Doc."	26-Feb-14

I did experience dry mouth at first but it subsided in a few days.  At a weigh in with my wonderful doctor on August 5, 2010 I lost 11 lbs.  My doctor started me with taking the medication for 2 months and then one month off until January 2012 and I now take the medication for 1 month and I&#039;m off of it for 2 months.  I am hungrier when I&#039;m off the medication but I have learned what portion sizes and types of foods to eat and have done pretty well maintaining.  You have to have determination and willpower for the rest of your life.  By the way, it&#039;s now April 7, 2012 and I weigh 148 lbs.  I have lost 104 lbs."	7-Apr-12

141292	Escitalopram	"This med is amazing. 23 year old christian college grad with every type of anxiety for the past 2 years. Could barely go to class or the grocery store, felt dissociated, distant and terrified of people (including friends). Was scared to try any drug but after losing my job and needing to go out and interview I decided to try something. 3 days in and I feel totally changed. No anxiety. Clear head. Feel like I could even move countries to work and I&#039;ve been out more in a weekend than I have been in 3 months combined. I take 5mg and 25mg of hydroxyzine to balance out the side effects (blurry vision, headaches, muscle spasms etc). Don&#039;t be scared just try it. I regret not going on this sooner."	14-Mar-15

This chest pain was interfering with my everyday life. I started avoiding many things that I thought would contribute to my chest pain all with no success. My doctor then said that it was anxiety. He prescribed zoloft and I was really hesitant to take it. I have never been on an antidepressant and I was afraid. Well today is my 6th day on it and I already feel an improvement. I haven&#039;t had any side effects well only the 1st night I couldn&#039;t sleep but all is well now. I don&#039;t want to be on this for ever. I am planning on taking it for 6 months.

141131	Escitalopram	"Been on lexapro for 6 weeks now. It has made a huge difference in my life. I&#039;m calmer, more focused, sleeping better, I can manage my issues with a eater mind. It&#039;s almost like your a more improved version of yourself. However, I have slight side effects such as diarrhea. But I can deal with that! Good luck all! Please give this medication  a chance to work before giving up on it."	20-Jul-15
140750	Escitalopram	"Been taking these meds for 2 weeks now. I was diagnosed with mild aspergers syndrome as a very small child and have had problems with anxiety &amp; my overall mental health for most of my life. Just recently, I started to have panic attacks (scariest thing ever, I thought I was dying). So while I&#039;m waiting to see a shrink, my GP prescribed me an antideppressant. It has significantly decreased my anxiety &amp; sadness. It is also excellent as a pain-killer (I have ankylosing spondylitis/arthritis too). Worked far better then any NSAID I have taken. Side effects are harsh though. I felt tipsy &amp; nauseous the first time I took it. Diarrhea. Nightmares. Severe restlessness. Racing thoughts. High sex drive that negatively interferes with day to day life."	19-Jul-16

141054	Escitalopram	"I&#039;m taking Cipralex. I was in a car accident and about a year after the accident I started getting anxiety.  My background: I was in the military and grew up on a farm. I was raised to be tough and to deal with my problems head on myself. The whole anxiety thing I thought was for weak people. People with weak minds who just couldn&#039;t handle life. The funny thing with anxiety is it does not make sense.  I was always an outgoing person up for anything at the drop of a dime. I started getting anxiety just talking to people and around my family. I would get these episodes of feeling like I was out of my body and spaced out. Not knowing how to respond or thinking the person I was talking to knew I was really anxious. Cipralex has saved me"	29-Sep-15
128221	Phentermine	"This medication saved my sanity and my life!! I have multiple severe autoimmune diseases so after gaining 45 lbs because of a horrible reaction to a medication, I didn&#039;t know what to do with myself. I tried everything I could to lose weight the &quot;natural&quot; way but nothing worked; my body and metabolism had changed. I hated the way I looked and felt. Thank goodness my family and SO were by my side but nothing helped me. I was THRILLED when I found out about phentermine. I did my research and even though there was scary stuff posted about it, I didn&#039;t care...I wanted this weight gone. And gone it went! 30 LBS IN 3 MONTHS! Yes, some people can have bad reactions but that&#039;s no reason to give it a bad review because it does what it&#039;s supposed to!"	10-Mar-16
71911	Tramadol	"This medication is about as strong as aspirin or ibuprofen. If you take them longer than a few weeks you will also end up with withdrawal worse than any other narcotic pain reliever. It can make you sick to your stomach and if your prescribed too much it can cause severe seizures. If you&#039;ve never been on any other opiate pain relievers it may work for a bit but I&#039;d use extreme caution in doing so."	31-Dec-15
138567	Phentermine	"My husband convinced me to see a weight loss specialist when he finally got tired of hearing me talk bad about myself. Two days ago I went, got weighed in, 174 lbs... my scale said 175 but I&#039;ll take their number. This morning I was 170 lbs. Wow. This really works. I have to force myself to eat. The house is always clean. &quot;Put the sweeper up&quot; my husband said to me today. I feel WONDERFUL. My mood is a constant pleasure to everyone around me. My skinny jeans I wore before my car accident two years ago are gonna get on my honey one way or another! Only downside to the doctor is he&#039;s going to kick me out of the program at 155 lbs but I was 120 before the wreck and that&#039;s my personal goal."	4-Apr-13
96416	Sertraline	"I&#039;m 19 years old, have 2 kids. I have been taking Zoloft 25mg since June of 2010 for anxiety, stress, and a little depression. I LOVE it. Before I was on it I was really bad, I could not go outside of my house without having a anxiety attack, couldn&#039;t drive or anything!  I tried to get over it by myself but I couldn&#039;t do it so I went for it and the first day I took Zoloft I noticed a difference (usually it takes a few weeks) the only side effects that I noticed was that I cannot sleep like I used to. If you are thinking about trying Zoloft make sure its a good idea for you, talk to your doctor and be sure to get as much info as possible and remember we are all different. You may or may not have any side effects, but it doesn&#039;t hurt to try. Good luck."	3-Jan-11
64905	Sertraline	"I have had anxiety, panic attacks &amp; obsessive thoughts for years on and off. About 5 months ago I started to get horrible non-stop intrusive thoughts I knew the thoughts/fears/worries were nonsense but I couldn&#039;t turn them off. I was in a panic attack from the moment I woke up to the moment I fell asleep. I would wake up several times at night in full blown panic....it was horrible. I never ever wanted to take medicine I was so afraid of it not working or it making me worse. Zoloft has helped me so much at first I had a good day then a bad day  and I wasn&#039;t sure if that was normal. after 2 months the doctor upped my dose then a month later I felt better then 100% still a little anxious during my period  but very mild and manageable."	10-Apr-15

142131	Escitalopram	"After I gave birth to my son (eight years ago) I began having major depression. I have tried everything. I went to a new doctor because the other one just kept adding more medicines. I was on wellburtin, serzone, prozac, cymbalta, seroquel,ativan,and celexa. So I tappered off everything except for seroquel to help me sleep. I only need ativan once in a while now, all because she put me on lexapro 20mg. This drug started working within 3 days for my anxiety. It does make me tired so I take it at 4pm and sometimes I don&#039;t even need my seroquel. I love this drug! I can&#039;t believe I didnt try this sooner."	22-Aug-08
141013	Escitalopram	"This drug has changed my life. I take 5mg only in the luteal phase and it has completely cured my severe PMT symptoms, I was anxious, paranoid, angry and tearful. I was pushing my family and husband away and falling out with friends. At the point of suicidal thought I couldn&#039;t take it anymore and contacted my GP. My only regret is not doing it earlier. I began on 10 mg but it was too strong for me, I was dizzy and hyper. After halving the dose it was like a magic switch being turned on and I immediately felt like my own self. I have no side effects coming off the drug at the end of my two weeks and just a headache for an hour when I restart them. No weight gain either, I&#039;ve actually lost 10lb cos I&#039;m energetic enough for the gym!"	30-Jan-16
72503	Tramadol	"I have suffered from Fibromyalgia for 20 yrs, diagnosed 11 yrs ago. I have been on Tramal SR for the past 8yrs. It allowed me to keep working although I now take the maximum allowable daily dose and sometimes have to top up with ibuprofen or codeine. If I miss a tablet pretty severe withdrawal symptoms but without it I wouldn&#039;t still be able to work. It saved my sanity."	15-Mar-11

64810	Sertraline	"I quit my birth control basically cold turkey which caused depression and panic attacks on a daily basis for over a month.  I couldn&#039;t get in a car without having an attack.  My doctor put me on sertraline and my depression lifted after about a week of taking it. It took a good month to actually work on the panic attacks.  I honestly did not think anything would help and that I would be reliant on my Ativan for life.  I haven&#039;t had to take my Ativan in about a week which is amazing!  The only noticeable side effects for me are restlessness and insomnia in the early morning.  The benefits far outweigh the side effects for me though!"	22-Jul-15
63848	Sertraline	"I took it for 5 months under prescription because of work related anxiety and developing sleeping disorder. The side effects: low mental capacity, low will power, emotionally dead, no libido, and memory and concentration impairment, and really feeling down.  My psychiatrist insisted that the side effects are actually manifestations of my anxiety. But my mental and emotional health were going down. &quot;It will work eventually&quot; he said on our last meeting. One day l  crashed my car against a wall. I stopped immediately the medication, went through one week or so of withdrawal hell. I quit my job, went on a holiday and never took a pill again. It took me two years to restore my abilities, partly because of anxiety, but mostly of Zoloft."	7-Sep-17

63872	Sertraline	"I was only able to make it 5 days.  I had nervousness from the time I woke up.  Sweaty palms, nausea, anxiety, vivid unpleasant dreams.  At times I would sleep for 12 hours and others maybe 3 hours.  I couldn&#039;t take it anymore.  I can&#039;t imagine dealing with those side effects for weeks.  I stopped and feel so much better.  It has taken about two days to feel better.  Good luck to everybody but that felt like pure poison to me."	3-Oct-17

This went on &amp; on &amp; on &amp; I was so lost. I&#039;d tried so many different medications &amp; none of them worked. I used to sit in my bedroom rocking backwards and forwards crying everyday. I self harmed so much my arms are now really ugly. Just couldn&#039;t die. Then..... escitalapram! Wham! It all went! Just like that. Literally 2 day&#039;s later after I started taking them the pain was gone. I&#039;ve been on them for 5 week&#039;s now &amp; I have never been happier! It&#039;s like a miracle!

Started weight 217 now 208 . I usually walk 2 miles but due to the heat I can&#039;t,  I was hoping for a bigger loss but I have constant back pain, which doesn&#039;t help having Cage in my back.

64856	Sertraline	"Hi I thought I would share my experience to help others make a good decision. 5 years ago I was diagnosed with a Panic Disorder, GAD, and Depression. My initial struggles ended up with me on Celexa. This drug did work but took a long time for to take effect. (4 months). Last September it finally just stopped working. I went through a major period of depression and withdrawls until I finally found Zoloft. I had immediate effects! It turned my life around I now have zero side effects. I do have some lingering anxiety but nothing I cant handle. Occasionally I take a clonazepam to settle my kettle."	7-May-15
64204	Sertraline	"I was taken off Citalopram after a relapse into depression due to bereavement issues and put on to Sertraline, initially 50mg/daily. This didn&#039;t work and so, on my GP&#039;s advice, my daily dose was increased to 75mg. This dose has also proved ineffective but, worse than that, it has triggered severe insomnia. As I write this, I have been awake for 22 hours straight and still don&#039;t feel like sleeping. I have also lost my appetite. I have taken many medications throughout my life (I am 56) but Sertraline is the only one where I have experienced any side-effects. I would be wary about taking this medicine."	9-Dec-16
64251	Sertraline	"After at least a year of worsening anxiety, I tried essentially anything I could think of to manage it, but resorted to something I never wanted to: medication. I started off taking 25 mg once a night before bedtime and it made me have some really vivid and bizarre dreams (I probably dreamt more in the past month than I have in the last three years combined) and kind of felt like I hadn&#039;t slept at all the next morning. The day after I started taking it, I felt Really exhausted and depressed. The second day I felt almost manic but every day after that, I&#039;ve felt amazing. No sickness to my stomach at thoughts that used to rule my life, and I&#039;ve got so much more energy. Give it a shot and keep in mind that it can take a few weeks to help. :)"	29-Dec-16
72448	Tramadol	"Have had restless legs syndrome for 7 years and MD tried multiple medicines (Requip, Neurontin, Carbidopa/Levodopa).  All worked OK but still had RLS in the day and night.  Then, I hurt my back and was put on Tramadol three times a day.  My RLS completely went away but I had problems peeing.  So, I went off and those symptoms went away (but the RLS came back).  So, now I take one pill a day and the RLS is gone and I have no side effects."	10-Apr-12
72161	Tramadol	"I was diagnosed with tendonitis and arthritis in the neck and was prescribed tramadol. It has really worked for me. I mostly take it at night, 1 tablet, to get some relief and some sleep for a few hours without pain. I used to take Percocet when I had a herniated disc in my back and although I got some relief, I was severely constipated, which I never am because I have colitis. After 2 bottles of stool softeners, a bottle of Metamucil, I was finally able to go. I got an intestinal infection because I couldn&#039;t go and I swore I&#039;d never take Percocet again. Tramadol is strong and can have side effects such as stomach cramps and nausea but only if taken on an empty stomach. It has to be taken with food to avoid the side effects."	14-Jan-15
138844	Phentermine	"I started phentermine only 4 days ago and I have already lost 10 pounds. I didn&#039;t think it was possible to lose this much so quickly. I weighed myself on 3 different scales and they all said the same thing. 10 pounds in just 4 days! I am so excited to see what happens in the next week or so."	25-Oct-10
64344	Sertraline	"I tried this med as a last resort. I had already tried birth control, Prozac and then a hysterectomy. I went to a new doctor desperate to find anything that would help. The mood swings, hopelessness, anger and lack of interest was interfering in my home and work life. I have been suffering for years and it was only getting worse. She suggested trying this medication in combination with a low dose hormone supplement. It has worked wonders! I am taking the 100mg dosage and I haven&#039;t had any side effects. I am 5 days past the time my PMDD should be starting up and feeling great!!!"	6-Oct-16
96202	Sertraline	"I&#039;m a 50 year old male diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder at age 25. Went through years of therapy and thought I&#039;d pretty much learned how to manage/mitigate anxiety. I recently came upon a scene where I rendered first-aid to a gunshot victim. Almost immediately afterward I felt &#039;hollow&#039; and began ruminating about death.  That event acted like a pebble rolling down a mountain and by last week I was experiencing a variety of physical symptoms on top of being angry and withdrawn. My Internal Medicine doctor suggested I go on Zoloft. Within an hour of taking the first 25mg tab I felt a gigantic sense of relief. Five days later I%u2019m still experiencing some minor  jitters and cotton mouth and my  mind races a bit. But the immense sense of relief is still with me."	5-Aug-11
140829	Escitalopram	"Last summer I was prescribed lexapro under the name Liberium for my anxiety and depression. I was told to take 10mg once a day, but to ween myself onto it by taking half a pill a day for a week or two. Most of my time on Lexapro was blurry; I couldn&#039;t remember a lot. People around me could tell that I wasn&#039;t right. I stumbled a lot, slurred my words, and generally felt very irritable. My anxiety was through the roof but I had absolutely no depression. When coming down from the med, about 3 hours before the next dose, I literally couldn&#039;t move. Coming off of the med one day gave me a panic attack and what was diagnosed as a pseudo-seizure: non epileptic seizing while remaining completely conscious. I was taken away by force by ambulance."	6-Jun-16
95845	Sertraline	"It does it&#039;s job. I&#039;ve been on it for 5 years off and on because of pregnancies. I made decision to come off it and its been 1 month and I must admit my mood is low and the dizziness is horrible."	11-Dec-13
128593	Phentermine	"I&#039;ve been taking this medication for 3 days now. The first day was a bit of a challenge as I felt very hyper. My mouth is dry, but from reading the results I am not alone.  I have noticed I eat less and not craving any junk food. My goal is to loose 15-20 lbs.  I am 5ft and weigh 143 pound. I appreciate all the reviews. They were very helpful."	31-May-15
127674	Phentermine	"I started phentermine  6 days ago. The first 2 days, I felt like I was in a fog. By the third day, the feeling passed. My starting weight was 273. My weight today is 266. Over Easter, I never had the urge to indulge in candy, or desserts! 10 years ago I had Lap Band surgery, and lost over 80 lbs. Since that time, I have regained about 40lbs. This medication is exactly what I need to jump start my weight loss. It suppresses  the feelings to over eat, or binge eat."	19-Apr-17
64683	Sertraline	"I began taking 25mg for 2 weeks and then went to 50mg, for depression. It&#039;s been about 6 weeks. So far, I have had no side effects, oddly enough. Maybe some slight dry mouth? I do feel that it is helping, in that I am focusing less on the sad feelings. I still have them, and there are still things in my life I need to change, but I&#039;m no longer dwelling on that as much. For me, it works well."	2-Jan-16
64485	Sertraline	"Ive been on zoloft (75 mg) for about a month now, and im just starting to feel the effect. Ive depression and anxiety, and all i can tell is that im still very sad but it&#039;s not the end of the world as before. I still cry sometimes but i dont want to kill myself anymore. But its strange not to feel like i used to be, i have the sensation that im functional and under control, but at the same time i feel like a robot or zombie, and thats weird, im not totally myself. But i guess this is better than the horrible anxiety i used to have. Sometimes i have headaches, im very sleepy and sweaty and talkative. Anyway, it is helping me for my anxiety, but depression barely improved."	12-Jul-16
63936	Sertraline	"After 10 days on Setraline, I was a walking zombie &amp; I felt like there was no hope. It had worsened everything x100. My unpleasant side effects (increased anxiety, dry mouth, dry eyes, dizziness, trembling, achy jaw, and decreased appetite) have finally settled &amp; I can honestly say I feel much calmer &amp; no longer have some of the awful/paranoid thoughts I used to have. I still have days where anxiety will try creeping up on me but it goes as quickly as it comes. I don&#039;t feel like it has worked absolute wonders yet but then my family/friends &amp;boyfriend have said they feel like they have got the &quot;old me&quot; back &amp; when I laugh now - it&#039;s a real laugh. The first 2 weeks are really hard but hang on in there. I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t give up early on!"	31-May-17

I have no clue of my weight now. But this pill I take gives me dry mouth and a slight fast heart beat.

I&#039;ve been taking 50 to 250 milligrams Zoloft for the course of almost 7 years, and I&#039;ve been getting 5 to 8 hours of sleep everyday. I was getting from C&#039;s and D&#039;s in school, to mostly A&#039;s and B&#039;s, and my memory was becoming crystal clear.  When I&#039;ve decided to go down to 25mg, I&#039;ve began to experience more anxiety, more depression, more insomnia, more OCD-like symptoms. Even if I had a good day under 25mg of Zoloft, I wasn&#039;t confident about myself and didn&#039;t like the person that I was becoming.

I am finally able to say that this medicine has CHANGED him and he is NOT a MONSTER anymore..His obsessive nature is GONE. I cried the first week he got on it and thanked God over and over..We tried two rounds of counseling combined with going to  church and the rage wouldnt go away so a relative of his suggested he take Celexa because he had the same disorder..He was put on Lexapro instead..I am VERY HAPPY now.."	6-Nov-13

I am so excited to finally see something that can help me reach my weight loss goals. The only things that I do not like is not sleeping well at night and waking up at the crack of dawn, and the nausea. I am not a good water drinker so having the dry mouth encourages me to drink water to satisfy my thirst. My starting weight was 213 and I want to reach my goal of 145, which was my weight before all my children. I only exercise three days a week right now and my eating could be better. So when I get completely on the right track with exercise and nutrition I have faith that I will reach my goal by summer."	12-Feb-10

I had a full meal one weekend night and have had healthy snacks here and there such as raw almonds and avocados. I&#039;ve been drinking about 1 gallon of water per day. I just worked out for the first time on day 6 so we&#039;ll see how my second week goes now that I&#039;m burning more calories.

Now I am motivated to get the weight off. I have to admit that I have not been following a strict diet but I have tried to watch what I eat and how much I eat. Also my love for candy has started to fade away, hot cookies are starting not to taste so good. Stay encouraged and pray for me. "	18-Mar-09

140548	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve experienced major depression along with high anxiety. Lexapro has been FANTASTIC for me in helping to get rid of my depression AND helping my anxiety significantly. I&#039;ve tried Prozac, and compared to the two Lexapro has given me much less side effects, has not interacted with other drugs I take, works faster, and has given me my life back. Overall, I think anyone who is suffering with depression, but also has high anxiety can definitely benefit from this drug. It&#039;s been great for me and I think it&#039;s worth a shot for anyone who isn&#039;t having much luck with other SSRIs."	12-Mar-17
128529	Phentermine	"I am now exactly one month in. My start weight was 301 and I am now at 278! Hooray! The only side effects I still have are dry mouth, nasty taste in my mouth, and jitters from time to time. I will update again in one month :)"	23-Jul-15
141059	Escitalopram	"I recently had an episode where my anxiety problem showed itself. I was hesitant to seek medical help or take any prescriptions. I am now very happy that I did. The medication settles me down and takes the edge off. I have not experienced any side effects. Actually, I don&#039;t even notice the meds doing anything. So I stopped for two days. That was a mistake. I quickly got really irritable and started experiencing anxiety by the end of the second day. So I started up again and it immediately went away. I hadn&#039;t realized that for most of my life, anxiety was getting in the way of thinking clearly. Now I&#039;m a believer."	18-Sep-15
72287	Tramadol	"Worked great for my fibro pain, but if I miss a dose I am very ill, everything from restless legs syndrome, pain all over, diarrhea, coughing and sneezing, and insomnia."	13-Feb-13
140588	Escitalopram	"this is the most amazing thing I have ever used. I suffer from a panic disorder, and 2 months ago I stated 10mg ciraplax. I now only have 1 panic attack every two weeks whereas i was having 2-3 a day. I dont sweat the small stuff anymore and overall have a better quality of life. only long term side effect I have experienced is complete loss of appetite, and noticeable weight loss (was 5&#039;7 and 118lbs before starting medication, so weight loss isn&#039;t beneficial). other then that no noticeable side effects. amazing medication, 100% recommend for anyone suffering from debilitating anxiety"	20-Nov-16
96293	Sertraline	"Been on 25 mg for 5 days now. Was on Lexapro 10 mg for 6 weeks before hand. After only 5 days I already feel better on the Zoloft than I ever did in the whole 6 weeks of the Lexapro. Keeping my fingers crossed that I will keep feeling better. So far so good..no panic!"	27-Sep-10
140881	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve always been an anxious person, usually I find my anxiety serves me well to stay on top of a busy household, but occasionally the anxiety is destructive instead, like after the birth of a child or difficult times.  I&#039;d had a horrid couple of years, nursing my mum to the end from cancer and eventually it caught up with me, panic attacks, health anxiety, obsession on breathing, palpitations constantly.  I went straight onto 20mg as had been on this drug briefly a decade ago.  The first 24 hours were weird, dizzy, disorientated, mildly nauseous and a huge panic attack. I only slept 3 hours a night for the first 2-3 days. By week 3 I sleep 8hrs a night, have energy during the day and zero anxiety. I feel great! Lexapro is great but be patient"	6-May-16
71604	Tramadol	"I have spinal stenosis and osteoarthritis in my back. I was referred to the pain clinic and they put me on Tramadol after 4 cortisone injections failed to help the pain. I take one 50 mg tablet along with 500 mg of acetaminophen every 6 hours as needed. It works very well in relieving the pain for me. I don&#039;t take it every 6 hours, only when I feel I need it, otherwise, I just tolerate it. I have had NO withdrawal symptoms or negative side effects and it makes my quality of life a whole lot better. It isn&#039;t perfect, but it works fine for me."	25-Jun-17
63929	Sertraline	"I was prescribed Zoloft for depression and I was on it for a month before I had to get off. After three weeks I started noticing a lack of feeling and it became difficult to orgasm and once the fourth week came around I was completely unable to orgasm. I want to give it zero stars because of how much that affected me personally but it did help a lot with my depression and I was starting to feel more like myself."	6-Jun-17
63976	Sertraline	"The first 2 weeks on Zoloft were like hell. I was drowsy, had nightmares and my stomach was a mess.  I&#039;ve been taking 75mg for 3 month now and I feel like a new person . I&#039;m mellow , easy to deal with and satisfied"	24-Jun-17
142108	Escitalopram	"Was prescibed Lexapro for anxiety and panic disorder.  Only could give this a neutral 5 rating as the side effects stopped me after a week from experiencing the possible benefits.  I am told that this is a very good drug by my doctor and shrink alike.  It gave me more anxiety and crazy chest pains.  I was on 10mg daily."	1-Mar-09
96090	Sertraline	"I am on 150mg of Zoloft (Sertraline) daily.  It has been a life saver.  My GAD is under control, and I am enjoying life to the fullest.  Gone are the days of constant worry and irrational fears.  I also experienced few side effects as well."	11-May-12
64071	Sertraline	"I began taking Zoloft in March 2015 after testing Lexapro and Prozac. My SA/MDD improved, but I still had a lot of trouble with socializing and suicidal thoughts, so I decided to quit taking it and also switched to online schooling. Around Jan. 2016, I noticed I was getting worse and finally decided to go back on the medication. I started 25mg with no change. Slowly began increasing it to my current dose of 100mg combined with 5-15mg Buspirone (previously .25mg Xanax) and this is the worst I&#039;ve ever been. I have nearly every side effect, even suicidal thoughts, and I have a panic attack just thinking of leaving my home and being around people. Definitely switching to something else soon."	4-Apr-17
140995	Escitalopram	"Day 1 : felt pretty much the same as before I started the tablets, did notice anxiety heightend first couple hours after the tablet. day 2 : felt slightly better than day 1 felt a little sick and had slight headache , was still up and down through out the day. Had upset stomach on the night but that didn&#039;t last long. day 3 : woke up feeling slighty better than day 2 still up and down. Had lower abdominal pain on and of throug the day but generally felt abit better. Anxiety wasent so bad after taking tablet unlike day 1 and 2.  Day 4 : woke up feeling better than day 3, feel like I&#039;ve got no emotions but feel a bit better. Haven&#039;t taken tablet yet so will write later on. today"	20-Feb-16
214561	Escitalopram	"Lexapro gave me terrible nightmares.  I jump out of bed while asleep. I tore both of my arms up and hit the closet door with my head.   I scream in my sleep, I break lamps with my flailing arms while I am a sleep.  Every side effect listed I have!  I fall all the time, I stumble around.  This is a terrible medicine!!  Never again!!  It seems to be taking forever to get out of my system after I stopped it (without my Dr permission).  What happens now can not be as bad as the side effects I have!!"	17-Oct-17
96971	Ambien	"I was dealing with severe insomnia for a few months. Dr prescribed 10mg. It helped me fall asleep noticably quicker. No sleepwalking or anything, but then one night my work woke me after an hour or so and I was slightly impaired; stumbling through bedroom and slurring words. Felt like being drunk except that my mind was still fine, just body delayed. Otherwise,  it has been free of side effects and gets job done - except for heartburn. Experience it nightly after taking ambien and take an antacids"	9-Nov-15
139037	Phentermine	"I started taking Adipex a week ago today. It has made me eat half of what I used to. I love the way it makes me think about what I am putting in my mouth. I have had the dry mouth and sleepiness at night side effects. In the last few days I have started experiencing severe blurred vision. I was just wondering if any one else has had this problem. By the way I lost 5 lbs the first week."	30-Apr-09
141354	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve been on escitalopram for almost two years. I started at 10mg and it didn&#039;t work to well. I recently went up to 20mg because I felt anxious about every little thing like before I started. Now, I feel awesome! I&#039;m happy at my job. I&#039;m more social at school. I always look on the bright side. It&#039;s really cool. And, it&#039;s not like an unnatural &quot;high&quot; or feeling. It&#039;s just like being myself but in a general good mood most of the time. Side effect is sexual, but I don&#039;t believe in pre-marital sex anyway. It goes away after I stop taking it. But, I find myself not thinking about sexual things so much. It&#039;s a definite plus! Keeps me on the right path."	4-Nov-14
128728	Phentermine	"On the recommendation of a friend I started taking Phentermine 37.5. Went to the MD on 3/30/15. I didn&#039;t want to wait to start next day so I took my first pill in the car at noon on the 30th. Starting weight 284.5lbs. Literally hunger vanished, no cravings. Woke up next day, lost 1.5 lbs. Today, 4/1, I am down 3.2 lbs and haven&#039;t even taken my 3rd pill yet. I&#039;m going to go to the gym today to see if that boosts the effect. I&#039;m eating very lightly. Trying to stay below 1200 Cals a day. This pill really helps with not making poor decisions. The doctor recommended drinking gulps of water between each biteful of food. And to unlearn the bad habit of eating til I&#039;m full or cleaning the plate. He recommended using a bread plate as my guide."	1-Apr-15
141398	Escitalopram	"I have been taking Lexapro for years with fairly good results and low side effects, usually between 10 to 15mg, I am a 44 y/o woman, mother and wife of middle school children, my anxiety/depression has gotten worse and I was recently diagnosed with OCD. I tried to increase to 20mg  but after 4 weeks felt lousy tired a lot, poor sleep,  gaining some weight, not much. I&#039;m going back to 15mg,  does anyone really think there is a difference between the 2 doses. I just want to feel happy again."	17-Aug-14
63906	Sertraline	"I have been on this medication for 2 years, before taking it I suffered from severe panic attacks and anxiety and social anxiety. I have not had 1 major panic attack since I started taking it so that in itself is awesome. However, I have gained 25 pounds on this and cannot seem to get the weight off and when I do lose weight I can&#039;t keep it off. This has resulted in other health problems like high blood pressure. I also have trouble reaching orgasm during the day but at night I&#039;m FINE. Given how horrible and anxiety ridden I was before taking the medication, it definitely works but the side effects (like the weight gain) are driving me crazy. It also hasn&#039;t taken away my social anxiety completely, I still get nervous around people."	11-Aug-17
141125	Escitalopram	"Don&#039;t try it, withdrawal is horrible. 5 days, no relief."	27-Jul-15
141975	Escitalopram	"This medicine was the first one I was put on. Works very well. I am ever so grateful for LEXAPRO. My side effects were being tired and sleepy at first. Now however (after 4 years) I find my sleep cycle is switched, I sleep during the day and I find myself up at night."	15-Aug-09
141262	Escitalopram	"(From a teen&#039;s point of view. I am currently 14) I developed severe Emetophobia at age 6 and then after 7 years of panic attacks and anxiety, at age 13 i got to the point where I was laying in bed for hours all day everyday begging my mom for a new type of medicine (I had previously been taking Mirtazipine for 5 years and it seemed to stop working) so I got prescribed with 5mg Lexapro  (liquid form) at 10 ml a day. It worked very quickly and I began to feel normal again. I was able to actually leave the house again without panicking and my anxiety decreased dramatically. It changed my life so much and has made me a lot less anxious. I didn&#039;t experience any side effects except for suicidal thoughts. those lasted for a few months."	12-Feb-15
71905	Tramadol	"I have been taking Tramadol for over 2 years now, and it has been helpful for my Arthritis and Fibromyalgia pain. It does not make the pain go away, nothing I have tried does, but it does dull it enough that I am not clenched up in a ball in bed in sharp pain all the time as I was before taking it. I wish it would last longer though, I start to feel relief about 2 hours after taking it and it wears off at 4 hours after taking it. Since I take it every 6 hours I am still extreme levels of pain most of the time, but for the 2 hours it is helpful I can manage to do basic tasks like get dressed, bathe, hold a pen, open doors which I am unable to do without it. I do not have any &quot;goofy&quot; side effects with Tramadol, so that is also good for me."	14-Jan-16
64492	Sertraline	"I had anxiety and panic attacks for about 3 years, I finally said enough was enough when I promised after another panic attack im going straight to the doctor and I did. And im glad I did, this drug makes anxiety come all the way down to a manageable level It takes about 2 months from my experience to work, iv been on 50mg for 5 months and I should increase my dose for the remaining anxiety but there&#039;s a reason I wont. The drugs sexual side effects are bad it lowers overall sex drive and makes it hard to climax very annoying.Thats the main reason I want to get off them as well as dislike of long term medication. For someone who is looking to try the drug but maybe apprehensive  Dont be scared to try this medication dont live in anxiety hell"	8-Jul-16
95912	Sertraline	"Only thing is sexual dysfunction as side effect is terrible."	22-Sep-13
96338	Sertraline	"My original experience with Zoloft was over ten years ago, during a serious depressive episode - it seemed to be effective as a stabilizer.  This past December, a doctor prescribed it again to help pull me out of another down-turn.  Within the course of a month I progressed from severe depression to ultradian mood cycling, which resulted in a nervous breakdown.  The cycling abated within a couple weeks of discontinued treatment with Zoloft. "	2-Oct-09
95932	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been on Zoloft for 3 months now and I&#039;ve got to say its been pretty good. I am on 50mg a day and sometimes I skip because I&#039;m not so worried anymore. Really has helped out a lot. I&#039;m making friends."	20-Aug-13
96167	Sertraline	"I just started Zoloft 3 days ago and am encouraged by those of you who say the drowiness goes away after a while. I am on the one week prior to my period regime, due to PMDD. It is amazing already how calm and patient I am with my kids and husband. I had been on other meds in the past for depression, but hadn&#039;t taken anything in a few years. I have to say for the last post, the Yaz can make you depressed and gain weight. I would have just done the Zoloft. Loving the Zoloft. Excited to see how I feel when the side effects go away."	5-Feb-12
128793	Phentermine	"This my second round with Phentermine.  I tried it a couple of years ago and lost 20 pounds and have kept it off.  I decided I needed to lose 20 more, so I&#039;m back on it as of yesterday.  I&#039;m already down 2 pounds!   My appetite is virtually gone!  I feel really good and have so much energy!  The only down side is insomnia, but I can live with that as long as I&#039;m getting great results!"	14-Jan-15
128235	Phentermine	"I&#039;m on my 4th day with these pills and I&#039;ve already lost 8pounds"	24-Feb-16
187628	Allegra-D 12 Hour	"I used to take an allergy drug called Ornade some years ago. It provided me instant relief of my allergy symptoms (hayfever and ragweed-related). Since then the only allergy medication that gives me that kind of relief is Allegra-D. "	20-Apr-08
71697	Tramadol	"This works great for me for migraines, neck pain, and in the past for severe menstrual cramping.  However, I find that I need to take about half dose. Instead of 50 mg every 6 hours I have to take less (25mg), maxing out at  225 mg per day. I rarely have to take that much anymore.  I tend to take Dramamine with it now or meclizine to avoid nausea ( although it doesn&#039;t always cause me to have nausea).   I did have one episode of respiratory depression after taking the normal dosage of 50 mg every six hours for menstrual cramps. About an hour after the third dose, I started feeling like I couldn&#039;t remember how to breathe. It was a very scary feeling. My husband watched me carefully and I probably should have gone to the emergency room."	23-May-17
95874	Sertraline	"It took a couple weeks to notice any positive affects. It does help with depression.  The big negative is the loss of the ability to achieve an orgasm."	8-Jun-14
140541	Escitalopram	"I have OCD, GAD, PTSD and depression, agoraphobia, panic attacks. It is helping. Early side effects were hard, nausea, insomnia and some higher anxiety. Take it in the am if you get insomnia ! This helped me. I&#039;m glad I pushed through the early side effects. It took over 7 weeks to start to feel better, so don&#039;t give up unless SEs are too bad. Some posts say it&#039;s a miracle cure. It&#039;s not, you still have to do the work: therapy, diet, self-help etc, but it can help with the fear and racing thoughts. It&#039;s helping me but if I&#039;d believed all the big claims here I&#039;d be disappointed.Keep your expectations realistic, give it time, and do everything else you can to be healthy. It&#039;s an aid, not a cure, but can help."	30-Dec-16
141760	Escitalopram	"I have had a recent history of anxiety and depression (last 5 years) and have tried several medications for both disorders.  Unlike Lexapro, I felt all of them had much more pronounced side Effects.  I have been taking 10mg of Lexapro for two months and feel it has really hit the &quot;sweet spot&quot;. The only noticeable side Effect has been a short period of &quot;the jitters&quot;.  I&#039;ll feel this is a really useful medication with a very pleasant &quot;mellowing&quot; effect."	4-Mar-11
127570	Phentermine	"I love the results of taking this prescription.  My only issue was my mood swings while on them.  I seemed to be mad a lot.  So I started just taking half a pill and it only got a little better.  That is the only reason I gave it a 9 and not a 10.  It works, but the effects it has on my mood are not good."	14-Jun-17
64558	Sertraline	"It&#039;s been over a year now that I&#039;ve been on Zoloft. I take 200 mg a day and I still  cannot believe how much my life has changed/improved!! I am 36 years old and had been suffering from severe  panic attacks, anxiety, and agoraphobia for almost 15 years...it was a complete challenge to get to work and even imagine a day without the feeling of anxiety from literally the time I woke up until I went to bed.. .I wasn&#039;t enjoying life at all, I was just existing. I had absolutely no control of my own conscious!! I finally decided that I had to try a prescription or else I would let this take over what little life I had completely! I started Zoloft on 25mg and worked up to the max of 200mg over about three months. It was the best decision ever!"	5-Mar-16
141671	Escitalopram	"I took Lexapro for 5-6 years started with 10 mg then eventually increased to 30 mg. It worked great for helping me keep calm, and helped my depression and was able to deal with stress, however the more I had to increase the dose the more tired I got, and I eventually got to a point I just could not function, it took everything I had just to get out of bed then maybe 2 hrs later I was ready for a 3-4 hour nap. My doctor then switched me back to 10mg and added Wellbutrin that worked good together but when I had to increase the dose of Lexapro I got to where I couldn&#039;t function again. Lexapro is a good medication at a low dose."	17-Jan-13
127956	Phentermine	"UPDATED REVIEW:  Okay, so I started Adipex on 9/15/16, I&#039;m 5&#039;5&quot; and at the time weighed 240. 16 days later (10/1/16) I&#039;m down to 228.  The side effects have subsided (insomnia, crashing, jitteriness, etc...).  I find that I can go the whole day without eating due to lack of appetite which is not good.  I do have to remind myself eat throughout the day, but that is not a big deal.  I would definitely recommend this product/medication to someone who is overweight and finding it hard to lose weight on their own.  So far it seems to be working! Let&#039;s see how the next month goes!"	1-Oct-16
97026	Ambien	"It helped me a lot. One pill and I sleep like a baby."	26-Aug-14
141020	Escitalopram	"Huge improvement after a few days. Been on this medication since June 11th, I&#039;m starting to feel unwell again I don&#039;t know if this med is failing. I&#039;m scared that I&#039;m going to relapse. I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. A couple of weeks ago my GP prescribed zyban with escitalopram. Zyban after three days gave me issues with tunnel vision. I will be asking for for another med to help with escitalopram for my increased anxiety and bad thoughts."	7-Dec-15
141094	Escitalopram	"I was prescribed escitalopram for anxiety and panic attacks. I did not have any difference in anxiety and instead suffered from extreme depression and suicidal thoughts within a few weeks of being on it. My doctor made me promise to try this one for at least 6 weeks and the feeling only got worse and worse. I had to slowly ween myself off (as warned to do), and feel 100x better with that stuff out of my system. Apparently this side effect is rare, but very scary."	24-Aug-15
119797	Ambien CR	"I have been using Ambien CR for 3 years. I love it. I make sure to take it on an empty stomach and in 20-30 minutes I am asleep.  The only things I would warn about is: make sure you have at least 8 hours of sleep time, it doesn&#039;t work well if you eat before taking the pill, and I have done some things I have no memory of doing. My husband has tried Ambien CR and said it doesn&#039;t work on him. I would recommend Ambien CR to anyone who has trouble falling and staying asleep."	1-May-09
140980	Escitalopram	"Lexapro has literally saved my life! Before starting the medication, I was terribly depressed &amp; suicidal.  I finally got the courage, with the help of my husband to talk to my physician.  I initially began on the 10mg dosage. The first week was rough with bad headaches, nausea and extreme fatigue. By the second week, the only side affect I had was a little spaciness that I feel was from the fatigue that had continued.  However; at week 2, I felt so much better. Now after 2.5 months and moving to a 20mg dose, I have my life back! I haven&#039;t felt this much peace in years. I can sleep. I can laugh. I can smile.....and I can&#039;t imagine taking my own life.  Best of all: I can love others because I&#039;m happy and at peace with myself. Worth it all!!!!"	22-Mar-16
128295	Phentermine	"I just started taking these pills on Jan. 4 2016 and I have nothing but energy after work. I am not back and forth to the vending machine. I usually stop at Wendys on my way home and ever since I took these pills I forgot Wendys was even there. I do experience dry mouth but that just keep you drinking water. Last night was probably the worst sleep I&#039;ve had in about 6 months man it was horrible. I think after this first week is over I will be used to this side effect.  So far great pill I&#039;m like never hungry I have energy I am at the gym yesterday I just did a quick cardio workout at home but I will up date you guys in about a month. Thank You"	6-Jan-16
63829	Sertraline	"I was prescribed Sertraline by my doctor as I am suffering situational depression. I am on day 4 (4th tablet). I don&rsquo;t feel any different - I was told 4-6 weeks it takes to feel any different. The side affects are awful but manageable. The worse bit is feeling sick, nausea. The only way to describe it is similar to hunger pain, your stomach constantly churns and it feels very uncomfortable, this has put me off a lot to continue. I feel like it&rsquo;s all I can concentrate on. I decided that taking it before bed was best as my stomach was affecting my work. I also found that it gives you head aches &amp; feeling zombie like. Very sleepy and tired... so I&rsquo;ve spent most of the week yawning at work. I haven&rsquo;t had any further symptoms yet."	1-Dec-17
140436	Escitalopram	"I was having horrible anxiety attacks, panic attacks and was border line manic. I was going through a lot of stress and hit my limit. My family urged me to see a Dr who started me on 2.5 lexapro for a week then up to 5 mg the week after. I stayed on 5 mg for 1 month seeing improvements. Eventually I decided to bump up to 7.5 which I&#039;m currently on . I still get anxiety but I am able to feel in control.  I don&#039;t have attacks anymore. I&#039;m sleeping better and eating again. Side effects only lasted the first month . I got really tired 20 min after taking it , drowsy, night sweats. Make sure to take it with a snack, I find it hits the stomach like a rock. Over all has given me my life back. And I don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m on medication."	18-Jun-17
128838	Phentermine	"I started in July. I was eating healthy but wasn&#039;t working out. The one week I started working out I lost 8pounds and no I don&#039;t take them every day. But working out is a plus. My goal is 175lbs, I am 240lbs, after a baby."	10-Sep-14

I also am changing my eating habits no fast food nor soda or caffeine."	5-Nov-14
141339	Escitalopram	"I&#039;m a 39 y/o female who experienced increased anxiety and finally anxiety attacks at night due to a series of health issues I was dealing with. After other treatments and trying to get off Klonopin I decided to try an SSRI. I started with 2.5 mg of escitalopram with immediate results of reduced anxiety. The next day I bumped it up to 5mg and then began experiencing terrible back pain from neck to hips and sciatica. I tried to stay on for a week but gave up and I am trying Zoloft now. Lexapro was very effective for my anxiety and panic. I did have 2-3 nights of bad insomnia that first week of Lexapro but it started to improve. I would be on it if not for back pain."	6-Jan-15

64980	Sertraline	"I am on day 16 of 50mg and I am starting to feel the benefits. The first few days I had heightened anxiety and low mood, headache, jaw clenching, no appetite, tummy upset but this has now passed. I still feel a bit anxious every now and then but I can actually now think positive thoughts and think about the future, which for the last 4 months I was a nervous wreck, I couldn&#039;t go out, I couldn&#039;t move off the sofa, I couldn&#039;t eat (lost 4 stone in 2 months ) my anxiety was so bad I thought I would be better off not being here, I didn&#039;t want to see or be around anyone from the way I was feeling, but it can now see light at the end of a VERY DARK tunnel. It took me 3 wks to pluck the courage to take them and I&#039;m so glad I did. THEY WORK!"	6-Jan-15
139118	Phentermine	"Phentermine 37. 5 is the only way I have been able to lose weight. I took it 2 years ago and lost 29lbs. I&#039;ve now gained back 30 lbs and work out 3 times a week."	30-Dec-08
128033	Phentermine	"Hello Everyone! I&#039;m 25 years old. I started my weight loss journey on March 27, 2016. My staring weight was at 289 and my height is only 5&quot;5. I knew I had to make changes in my eating habits and lifestyle. Started taking phentermine on March 27th. I had a hard time sleeping at first and of course dry mouth - which just means I need to drink plenty of water. Yes! It does curve my appetite but the point of the pill is to eat more, but more HEALTHY choices and workout.  I just had a weigh in on August 3rd and I weighted 254. My goal weight is between 185-220. Next weigh in I hope to weights around 245 or less. I will keep everyone posted."	9-Aug-16
72281	Tramadol	"Ultram is the only medication I can take for pain that doesn&#039;t make me sick.  Lortab, Norco, etc. all make me sick at my stomach. Darvocet used to be what I preferred as it didn&#039;t make me feel sick, hate that it was taken off the market. But after hand surgery and being prescribed Ultram, it&#039;s nice to know there is a pain medication out there that works and doesn&#039;t make me throw up. Highly recommend."	10-Mar-13
141637	Escitalopram	"This medication didn&#039;t do anything for my clinical depression or anxiety, but it did help me  gain about 90 pounds which I desperately needed due to my anorexia."	22-Mar-12
214687	Escitalopram	"I was taking Celexa for 6 years. It didn&#039;t work for me like it once did. I&#039;m 44, hormones are changing. Started Lexapro 4 weeks ago. No side effects, happy and feeling very positive, normal. Once in awhile, I feel angry, but yoga takes my anger away quickly."	1-Oct-17
128580	Phentermine	"I went to a weightloss clinic on Tuesday June2nd . I have been battling my weight for years ( ever since I had 4 kiddos) I&#039;m 5&#039;5 and my starting weight was 184.4 lbs I started the script the same day that I had it filled and as of today Friday June 5th I am down to 177lbs ! This is absolutely unreal! 7lbs in 3days !   I have had slight insomnia , constipation and crazy dry mouth all of which are easily solved . a lil melatonin for sleep , cascara sagrada for constipation and tons of water for dry mouth . I can&#039;t wait to see where I am at the end of june !!!"	5-Jun-15
140667	Escitalopram	"30. Male. I was completely lethargic and I had pretty bad anxiety. I always stressed about job assignments at work and rarely ever wanted to leave my room at home. I had no energy and I frequently called into work. I thought I had low testosterone so I had some bloodwork done, my doctor prescribed me lexapro 10mg in the meantime and I felt my anxiety and depression just disappear. I remember the moment I knew the medication was working when I was sitting on my porch feeling glad to be alive for once, enjoying the weather and just smiling. I feel like my old self before the crazy depression. Yawning and diarrhea is annoying. But I&#039;ll take that to enjoy little pleasures in life again."	20-Mar-17
140421	Escitalopram	"After struggling with some intense bouts of anxiety and depression the past year, I knew it was time to seek help. My doctor prescribed me escitalopram at 5 mg., and I am already feeling some positive effects after 3 weeks. Before I started this medication, I was sleeping most of the day, had no motivation, isolated myself from family and friends, dreaded work, and was overall just a miserable person. No, this medication doesn&#039;t make my life perfect by any means, but I feel my moods are stabilizing and I feel more confident in myself to handle my anxiety and depression in healthier ways. I am beyond grateful for this medication, and I hope to see even more success as time passes."	7-Jul-17
97140	Ambien	"I have used Ambien for 6 years. It worked very well all the time before they introduced the generic brands. The generics are NOT the same as the original and do not produce the same results. They leave me hung over and each manufacturer has his own brew thus are unpredictable in how they will perform. I have offered to pay the difference to get the real Ambien but with no success. Sure wish this wasn&#039;t so expensive."	30-May-11
97129	Ambien	"For the first time I can get to sleep every night.  It usually gives me about 5 hours of sleep, and if I wake up and take about 0.15 Klonopin, I can go back to sleep for another 3 hours.  Feel rested for the first time in years!  I don&#039;t take it until I am absolutely ready to lay down in bed, then lay down and think happy thoughts to carry with me to dream land.  Previously, due to bipolar insomnia,  I would take tons of Nyquil, Benadryl, Sominex, l-tyrosine, melatonin that only gave me a few hours sleep and I&#039;d wake up and take more pills. For years I couldn&#039;t sleep in a bed but would wander through the house at night trying to get comfortable on the floor, etc. as my husband just bumping me would wake me up.  I thank you Ambien!"	7-Sep-11
141664	Escitalopram	"It causes me to shake constantly and gives me a feeling like I&#039;m about to vomit for hours. It also keeps me awake all night."	27-Jun-12
71977	Tramadol	"My experience with this drug is not a good one. I was taking tramadol for years and every few months had to up the dose. When I would run out because my body became use to drug I would take more and more to help with my joint pain. I would take 4 50 MG at a time 3 times a day.  Which is not okay and experienced horrible side effects. I now have seizures at night and have been off the medicine for a while. The shakiness and nausea from not having the medication is sometimes unbearable. I also have tremors and moodiness as well as a zapping feeling in my brain. I would call this drug the devil. When you come off of it your pain is ten times worse than it was before. It&#039;s like it mimics the pain. It is very addictive and would not recommend it"	16-Aug-15
140922	Escitalopram	"Moved and my new doctor took me off Paxil and put me on Escitalopram.  Works better than Paxil with no side effects.  I function like a normal person.  I get little anxiety attacks out of nowhere, but if I sit down and still my thoughts, the butterflies go away.  My doctor gave me a script for klonipin for the attacks, it works well, but I only take if it gets bad.  Can&#039;t drive taking klonpin, feel a little too mellow."	22-Dec-15
72167	Tramadol	"Does not work for me at all. If I increase dosage it just makes me feel weird and lightheaded and a little bit dizzy."	15-Sep-14
71648	Tramadol	"This works well for me IF I take it with aspirin and tylenol. By itself, it does little - it would not be worth getting.  It also helps with sinus and/or migraines, again, only coupling it with aspirin and tylenol.  I have never had any of the &quot;interesting&quot; side effects that people describe, nor addiction.  I use it when I need it.  I can&#039;t help but think that the &quot;druggies&quot; (as someone else put it - pretty good descriptor) just THINK this stuff acts like a narcotic, and voila, placebo effect.  I just had to get a newly state mandated drug screen for this med.  I was squeaky clean, but also got a bill for $911 from the lab for the screen.  Thanks, druggies, for making it exceedingly difficult &amp; expensive for those of us who are legitimate."	31-Aug-17
78535	Allegra	"I suffer from chronic sinusitis caused by allergies.  I also had a bad case of bronchitis a year and a half ago and 3 respiratory infections since.  I have tried a bunch of antibiotics, Claritin D, Zyrtec, Bendryl, Mucinex, Singulair, cough syrups and other OTC decongestants, herbal supplements, steroids, and the Neti Pot. Only the Neti Pot helped me feel better for an hour or so and washed away a lot of the allergens but the sinus inflammation and bronchial irritation due to post nasal drip returned fast. I just started using Allegra 3 days ago and the difference is remarkable.  I can breath again! I also sleep better and I don&#039;t feel tired all the time. I have not experienced any side-effects so far."	20-Dec-09
63855	Sertraline	"It help me tremendously, I have a better life now thanks this medication. I feel great about myself and take life as it is, all my negativity has gone. I feel I can breathe again and the heavy baggage I have carried all my life has gone also. I&#039;m happy and everyday feels good!"	30-Aug-17
140620	Escitalopram	"Use less benzos now that I&#039;m taking Lexapro. Works well for anxiety!"	25-Dec-16
64141	Sertraline	"Took 50mg for 3 months.  Gave it that long due to all the positive reviews. Unfortunately, I felt depressed, had nightmares, felt foggy-headed and it didn&rsquo;t help anxiety.    1st week: I experienced an extreme increase in physical energy, but not mental energy - I felt more depressed than I have in years. To combat this I went cycling hours &amp; hours each day. If anyone has similar experiences in week 1 I wouldn&#039;t recommend continuing!  Weeks 2/3 I felt tired &amp; an increase in general anxiety. I also lost quite a bit of weight due to loss of appetite. Started having difficulty getting to sleep.   There was an improvement in side effects by month two, but no benefits. The one positive aspect was it seemed to cure my binge eating while taking it!"	5-Apr-17
127580	Phentermine	"I started phentermine on 7/11/17 at 342lb. I went back to the doctor on 7/18/17 and am at 325 I have lost 17 pounds on this. I feel great I work out 5 times week and am on a 1000 calorie intake till I lost 25 pounds then I can start eating carbs but for right now am only on protein"	20-Jul-17
63797	Sertraline	"I was prescribed this a couple of months ago for severe anxiety and postpartum depression after an ectopic pregnancy. I felt euphoric for the first few days, and was literally awake for over 48 hours straight. But after the initial side effects wore off I was so thankful for this meditation. I was always against antidepressants and believed I could just &#039;get over it&#039; with my mind...but after losing the baby my anxiety was through the roof and I couldn&#039;t function like a normal person. I&#039;d come home from work and hide in my room away from my family, I avoided leaving the house unless I absolutely had to, I&#039;d spend all day exhausting myself. I now feel more like myself than I have in years."	28-Oct-17
140893	Escitalopram	"The first six weeks were hell.  Increased anxiety so severe I lost seventeen pounds. I&#039;m now five months in and have never felt better.  I&#039;m on 20 mg  of lexapro once daily 20mg of Buspirone twice daily.  .5 mg of Clonazepam to be taken once daily if needed, I rarely need it.  I would suggest trying a physician that will prescribe a low dosage of Clonazepam from the start, it would have saved me a great deal of suffering .  Clonazepam is addictive so most doctors hesitate to prescribe it straight out of the box.  Good luck and stick with it."	26-Jan-16
139063	Phentermine	"Awesome appetite suppressant. Lost all of my baby weight in 2 months. "	30-May-09
138491	Phentermine	"I usually don&#039;t give reviews but for Adipex is necessary that I share with you. I started on 3/4/14 at 215 pounds, today 4/7/14 I&#039;m @ 198lbs. In only 33 days I&#039;ve lost 17 lbs. I&#039;m eating healthy and small portions, cause I don&#039;t get hungry.. I don&#039;t crave nor look for fast food restaurants. I&#039;ve added more fruits and veggies into my menu. I&#039;m staying away from sugar and bread. I&#039;m thirsty all the time, water, water is my best friend. If you are reading this I was just like you 30 days ago reading and trying to find out if this would work, and my answer is &quot;YES&quot; it does. Just take it day by day and eat right and exercise. Will give my next update at the end of April."	7-Apr-14
127402	Phentermine	"* EDIT last entry didn&#039;t include score  I&#039;ve been on Lomaira for about 8 weeks and have had success. My doctor first put me on 37.5 mg generic phentermine, but I couldn&#039;t stop sweating and it was giving me anxiety. I was definitely eating less, but I hated the feeling. My doctor told me a new weight loss medication was now available that was more targeted to evening when I tend to over eat after work. It&#039;s definitely a bit more expensive. I&#039;m paying $29/month and the generic was about $18/month. I prefer the brand and I like starting on this low dose. You can go all the way up to 24mg with this so I will probably stay on lomaira for a while. I&#039;ve lost about 18 lbs in 2 months. I don&#039;t like drugs so I&#039;m happy to use less phentermine"	4-Dec-17
97328	Ambien	"It is fantastic that it wears off so quickly - no residual tiredness in the morning like other sleep-aids.  I do wish it lasted longer.  It really only keeps you asleep for ~4 hours.  I guess that&#039;s what Ambien CR is for."	11-Sep-09
72517	Tramadol	"I have suffered from low back pain for the past two years. I became extremely depressed when I could find no relief from my pain-nothing mattered to me. I have now been taking Tramadol regularly for the past three months and feel I have control of my life/pain. I am able to perform most activities again and am even back at work. This drug saved me."	10-Apr-10
63839	Sertraline	"Military Combat veteran with previous history of trauma. After ten years of talk therapy, Zoloft cut panic attacks almost to nothing, also brought about a lot of memories, and real therapy finally began.  Erectile dysfunction curbed with Buruprion daily and Viagra for intercourse.  It took 4 days for side effects to wear off, it took about three months for therapeutic benefits - went back to school, made friends, found a girlfriend etc."	10-Nov-17
214554	Escitalopram	"Lexapro pretty much saved my life at one point. I&rsquo;ve had anxiety/depression all my life but a few years ago I was at a low point. I wasn&rsquo;t getting out of bed and felt like I had no reason to even get up in the morning. One day I decided it was time to live again and I saw a psychiatrist. He prescribed me 10mg of lexapro which I was advised to take half of for the 1st two weeks. As most people have mentioned, the 1st few weeks are for SURE not a good time. If you were already dealing with bad depression, I would advise that you stay close to good people for the 1st couple of weeks. I promise you though, it gets better if you wait it out. MAJOR sexual side effects (as in NO sex drive whatsoever) but if you have bad anxiety, it&rsquo;s worth it."	25-Oct-17
140443	Escitalopram	"I have anxiety and slight depression due to stress.  This is my first week on Lexapro and I was given 10mg which I  couldn&#039;t take as it made me very out of sorts, dizzy, stomach issues. So cut it down to 5mg symptoms are still there with the &quot;out of it&quot; feeling dazed and my body feels kinda tingly/numb and I have a headache which I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s Lexapro related or allergy related. Also makes me jittery. I&#039;m really sleepy too and I take it at night.  Not sure I&#039;m going to keep taking it. I don&#039;t like this out of it feeling.  But I am calmer and not so quick to yell at my kids."	12-Jun-17
141808	Escitalopram	"Last year I broke out in hives all over my body from an allergic reaction.  Had panic attacks and suffered from anxiety - tingling in head, crazy numbness and so on, all anxiety symptoms, made me feel like I was going crazy. Lexapro has been a miracle medicine for me. I&#039;ve been taking it for about 6 months.  I feel so much more calm and no more anxiety symptoms or panic attacks."	8-Dec-10
128078	Phentermine	"Hi everyone!!    I am a 33 y/o wife and mother of 4 beautiful children ages 11, 9, 7, and 3.  My last baby was born via c-section.  After my first 2 children, I was able to bounce back quickly.  After my 3rd child, it was difficult to get the weight off and after my 4th, it seems impossible!  I&#039;m a stress eater most definitely.  I scheduled a visit with my doctor and expressed to her how awful I felt by not being able to lose weight.  She informed me that my BMI is 36 and it&#039;s supposed to be 25!  I weighed in at 219lbs and I&#039;m 5&#039;5 and 1/2!  I started taking the generic form of Adipex at 37.5mg on 07/19/2016.  I weighed in this morning 07/22/2016 and I&#039;m 216lbs!  I&#039;ve already lost 3lbs in 4 days!  More updates to come!"	22-Jul-16
64568	Sertraline	"Hello all. I just want to say I am so grateful for this page! I am up at 330am with my 4th 4plus days long panic and anxiety attack in as many months. I tried the zoloft bc I had great success with it when I had post partum.  I am extremely leary of medications because of a bad drug reaction that I had to some meds. So when I started the zoloft again and got a headache which triggered a panic attack. I stopped. I went too much too fast. And now after seeing so many great reviews.  I&#039;m gonna give it a try again. And hope I can come back and give this a 10!! You guys know my pain. So thank you so much!!!!!"	25-Feb-16
128545	Phentermine	"OK ladies (and gentleman)  I cannot believe this I LOST 13LBS  IN 5 days. I started When 6-29-15 weighing 269.. I went to the doctor 7-3-15 and weighed 256 (no way).. Im still in shock.. My husband is so scared because he never seen anything like it. I completely changed the way I eat.. I only eat grilled or baked foods, fruits and lots of water with lemon (my skin is now amazing). I eliminated everything that&#039;s not clean. I removed fast food, soda, salts, sweets basically everything that was killing me slowly. The appetite suppression is amazing and allows me to make better and healthier decisions.. I have had side effects but they are starting to subside. I do not own the a scale but my clothes are getting very lose."	7-Jul-15
96076	Sertraline	"My main problem with this medicine was it made me have ZERO interest in sex, and a ZERO ability to have an orgasm.  So instead of taking this medicine, I recently went to see my doc and informed her that I wanted to get off it.  She really tried to convenience me to stay on them, but I insisted that with my new eating habits, exercise program (and lack of holidays), I was doing much better, mentally.  She insisted that it was due to taking the medicines that I felt better; but to be honest, I&#039;ve always had a positive attitude about life and the atrophies that occur.  But during the holidays when she prescribed the Zoloft to me, I was depressed. "	19-Jun-12
127953	Phentermine	"I took 37.5 at 7:00am   First five minutes I felt a warm sensation all over; about 20 minutes later I felt as if my body was drunk and heavy. Then a burst of energy came I could not stop moving for the next 4 hours. I detailed cleaed my whole house. I could not eat  (eat before the pill) food was a turn off for me. I felt full and satisfied with 2 cracker&#039;s. I only gave it a 7 because I was very nauseous. I vomited without warning on my floor. Stayed pretty sick to my stomach all day. I lost 2 lbs the first day."	5-Oct-16
127759	Phentermine	"Works wonders with no more than 800 calories a day a lot of water and mild exercise."	14-Feb-17
64028	Sertraline	"Most notable change is my appetite.  I&#039;ve been athletic my whole life, but gained 40 pounds in one year of from compulsive binge eating.  I thought I was just being a pig, which perpetuated the horrible cycle of depression and anxiety.  Turns out I was just really, really low on seratonin.  The cravings / irrational food addiction went completely away at around 75mgs.  Now I have to make an effort to eat enough to fuel an active lifestyle.  Stress and anxiety and depression subsided gradually.  They&#039;re not completely gone, but they&#039;re manageable now.  Combined with a healthy life style and some intense therapy, I&#039;m able to overcome bouts of anxiety and depression, and those bouts are shorter and less severe.  A tool, not a magic pill."	24-Feb-17
95902	Sertraline	"I had situational depression and was started on 50mg of Zoloft. It helped within a few weeks, but I had some major diarrhea when I started which seemed to start resolving itself, then I was upped to 75 mg and the diarrhea started again. It&#039;s been 10 months in total, and I still have episodes of diarrhea a few times a day for a few days. Then for a day or two I will be fine. I&#039;ve lost about 19 pounds due to the appetite suppression effects and the diarrhea. I&#039;ve also noticed a loss of libido but these are side effects I&#039;m willing to live with as opposed to the depression. I am having my recommended at age 50 for screening purposes colonoscopy soon and am sure the diarrhea is not a cause for concern. We will find out."	21-Oct-13
141271	Escitalopram	"I felt like I was going to die and kept passing out. Lost my job, my activities ended and I was a complete mess Dec 2014 my first time suffering from this after being hospitalized because I didnt know what was wrong after numerous Drs and medications. Lexapro was prescribed and after 2 weeks I felt a difference after 3 months, I was back on my feet after 6 months, I was driving and caring, again after 1 year I can work again."	9-Apr-15
141401	Escitalopram	"Finally I found a depression/anxiety medicine that has the least amount of side effects. Tried Elavil, Prozac, Desyrel, Paxil and citalopram (Celaxa) which is very similar to Lexapro but the Celaxa made me sweat when I was not hot, jaw tension, insomnia and hypertension. I think Escitalopram (Lexapro) is the best SSRI out there. I give it a 9 on the scale."	3-Aug-14
140470	Escitalopram	"After regularly seeing a cognitive-behavior psychologist, who helped me so much, I decided that although my anxiety was significantly reduced, and I was beginning to feel and act like a normal human being, I felt I would benefit even more if I took medication in addition to therapy. Although I was getting far fewer panic attacks than when I had started therapy, I still got them occasionally. I wanted to prevent them permanently, and take the edge off generally. My psychiatrist, and my dad who is also a psychiatrist, recommended Lexapro. Lexapro is the first and only anti-depressant I&#039;ve ever taken, and I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever switch! I am the happiest I&#039;ve ever been. Lexapro and therapy have helped me begin to love and respect myself. 10/10"	18-May-17
72106	Tramadol	"I&#039;m 20 and have a combination of anxiety, mild depression, and TMJ pain. For anxiety I tried Zoloft, Xanax, Klonopin, etc. Zoloft did nothing, and while the others worked, I couldn&#039;t use them long term. Tramadol is the miracle, road-runner medication. It covers all of my conditions and covers them great. It eases my jaw pain for 4-5 hrs and my mood/anxiety is pretty much nonexistant. I also have 0 side effects and don&#039;t find it addictive. Tramadol gave me my life back and will continue to! 10 star medication!"	2-Nov-14
64058	Sertraline	"I started Zoloft because I was struggling with obsessive, repetitive thoughts about bad things happening to my children which made me anxious all the time.   The first 3 weeks were hell. Even the Klonopin the doctor gave me to get through it didn&#039;t help. It felt like my anxiety levels tripled. I could barely function. Between weeks 4-5 I transitioned to just feeling as anxious as I had been before. Then it felt like a balloon was inflating inside my head (in a good way), and the anxious thoughts were bouncing off the balloon instead of being allowed to collect and swirl around torturing me.   Then I started having moments of feeling GOOD. And those moments grew into my new reality. My anxiety is 90% better. Zoloft gave me a new life."	1-Feb-17
34363	Tramadol	"Very few side effects.  A little fatigue now and then, but you get that with Fibromyalgia anyway.  It has greatly improved my quality of life and attitude towards life in general.  I&#039;m a much happier person having limited pain now."	30-Jun-08

141342	Escitalopram	"I was taking it with pauses for 4 years. It eradicated my anxiety but gradually it eradicated also my libido. No visual stimulation, spontaneous erections, lust and passion. I am 36 in good shape and don&#039;t have other health problems."	2-Jan-15
141601	Escitalopram	"Lexapro has changed my life. I am now able to participate in so many activities that my anxiety wouldn&#039;t allow me to do prior. There is side effects. I don&#039;t sleep great and have crazy dreams. Dry mouth, skin and eyes is noticeably worse. Sexual feelings came back after a few months. Plus have more gas and stomach upset. But even with the side effects, my life has greatly improved."	27-Feb-13
64322	Sertraline	"I suffered from severe anxiety for years particularly social anxiety. Been on 100mg a day for about six months now. I feel like a new person now ,feel normal and calm and doing things I hadn&#039;t thought possible. For me this is a wonder medicine. Took weeks before I felt an improvement but well worth sticking with it. Don&#039;t want to stay on it long term but worried about stopping as I never want to go back to chronic anxiety again. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s different for some people but I never felt better since taking Zoloft. Hope this helps"	25-Oct-16
64512	Sertraline	"I am in my early 50s.  The &quot;docs&quot; gave me this med initially for &quot;stress&quot;.  I was referred to a &quot;psychiatrist&quot; right after &amp; I complied.  The &quot;Psychiatrist&quot; announced I had &quot;full blown clinic depression&quot; even though all I felt was stress.  I took the medication as prescribed (25mg), &amp; had to endure 1 week of agony, but figured it was part of &quot;the drug&quot;.  I had muscle twitches, sweating, hot/cold sensation was thrown off, Blood pressure would shoot up &amp; drop low, NO SLEEP at all for 1 week, before the &quot;medication&quot; took hold.  Getting off the crap was just as bad if not worse.  As a result of this med, I have become well acquainted with the local Sheriffs Dept, who showed up twice to &quot;Baker Act&quot; me For the side-affect - suicidal thoughts."	19-May-16
64133	Sertraline	"I was on Cipralex for 8 months and many other meds. Zoloft is the first one that has given me a positive effect. It&#039;s less than 2 weeks but I have been so much better. I started at 25mg for 7 days than 50mg for 5 days. I will go to 75mg this week and hopefully that will give me all I need to be 100%."	8-Apr-17
128291	Phentermine	"This is my second time on phentermine 37.5 mg Last March I took the meds and  my was weight 198 and by July My weight was 173 I was extremely happy, but ran out of pills and money so I had to stop taking them. But I only gained 5 of those pounds back while off the meds. Now here I am again determined to reach my goal of 160.0 pounds I just recently started back on the medicine on Jan 2,2016 weighing at 178.8 and now a week and day later I&#039;m down to 174.4 I encourage any body that wants to make a change in there life to give this a try."	11-Jan-16
63861	Sertraline	"I was on 50 mg for a month and it seemed to help a bit. My doctor and I agreed to up to 100mg last week. Since then my anxiety and intrusive thoughts have been awful. Is this just a side effect until it balances out?!"	26-Aug-17
140658	Escitalopram	"It really helps my anxiety, but it makes me pretty drowsy"	30-Mar-17
138769	Phentermine	"I have been taking this medication for about 6 weeks and have lost 12 pounds, including 5 inches off my hips and 2 inches off my waist.  I exercise 5 days a week.  It is an intense work out which includes cardio and weights.  I do not feel as hungry all of the time like I did before.  I drink a gallon of water a day if not more.  I have experienced a few side effects like dry mouth, rapid heart rate, some constipation, and headache.  I want to continue until I reach my goal and do not want to give up!  Seems like in the past I always give up, but not this time.  This works really well and highly recommend this.  I have 25-30 pounds more to go!"	27-Sep-12
141333	Escitalopram	"8 years ago I had my 3rd child, a healthy baby girl, and suffered from horrible postpartum depression.  My OBGYN put me on 10 mg Lexapro and after a few more terrible days and a trip to the ER I ended up in a psychiatrist office. He added mirtazapine to help me eat and sleep and in 2 weeks I was much better.  I was able to stop the mirtazapine and took the Lexapro for a full year. I am so grateful to those 2 Dr&#039;s who helped me crawl out off a very dark hole.  A month ago I fell back in and my anxiety kicked into high gear. I was barely functioning.  After 2 weeks my psychologist put me back on 10 Mg Escitalopram.  I am entering my 3rd week and feel much better.  This medicine has been wonderful.  Prayer   medicine   talk therapy."	12-Jan-15
96341	Sertraline	"Helped with my mood really well. But I had severe tremor which I had to endure for a month before it could be stopped. The tremor did not ease at all, it even made my feet shake when they were off the floor and my jaw. If you can put up with tremor it definitely helps with lifting your mood!"	28-Sep-09
140712	Escitalopram	"Amazing keep at them.   We can all get thought this!"	9-Oct-16
128854	Phentermine	"I started taking phentermine on 7/18/2014 and as of a week later 7/25/2014 I lost 8 lbs. Dry mouth has been my only side effect."	30-Jul-14
141857	Escitalopram	"Very helpful."	4-Sep-10
141836	Escitalopram	"I had irritable bowel syndrome for 6 years and in the last 3 years it was preventing me from having a good quality of life. I was too anxious to do so many things because I couldn&#039;t trust my body to hold it together for any length of time. I tried hypnosis, mindfulness and naturopathic treatments but then asked my doctor about SSRI antidepressants. The first few weeks are awful but stick with it. I was in emergency because I had a panic attack and thought I was dying. I am now on 15mg Lexapro. It has been 3 months and this is truly a miracle. I feel totally normal and feel every emotion except I just think and ruminate less. I don&#039;t obsess anymore about leaving the house-I just leave. The drug has also been constipating for me, which after 6 years of irritable bowel syndrome is incredible. Highly recommend. "	1-Aug-11
34183	Tramadol	"I was prescribed tramadol 50 mg for a herniated disc. Two days ago I was not able to move because of the pain, I even had my legs buckle a couple times due to intense bursts of pain. 1 pill will dull the pain to a manageable level, 2 stops it completely. It does make me a little sleepy, but drinking coffee during the day kept me alert enough to work. I&#039;ve had no problems achieving an erection, but have not been able to &quot;finish&quot;. That is the only side effect I&#039;ve experienced to far. I am taking it with naproxen as an anti-inflammatory."	29-Apr-09
96391	Sertraline	"Zoloft works for me. I&#039;ve tried other medicines, and had too many unfavorable side effects. Zoloft has just sort of evened me out. I can cope now, with therapy of course. I&#039;d recommend Zoloft for anyone who has bad side effects from other medicines, and who is getting therapy too. I&#039;m on a high dose, and my doctor wants to start weaning me off soon, so the therapy is key, I think."	26-Nov-09
128652	Phentermine	"1st 2 days were great. Took it on an empty belly, felt that euphoric feeling that people mention. Did have trouble sleeping that night. Woke up every 1 to 2 hours. Skip to day 3 I was so exhausted about 2 hours after taking the Phentermine. Doctor suggested to wait longer to eat after taking them. That did the trick. By this time I was taking Unisom or Zzzquil to help sleep at night. That works wonders. Now I&#039;m 3 weeks in and have lost 4 pounds. I would have liked to seen amazing results like everybody else but I&#039;ll take the 4 lbs. Also I&#039;m only on 15 mg. I started at 203 and am at 199. I go in for my 1 month checkup and we&#039;ll see what he thinks of the progress."	14-Apr-15
34214	Tramadol	"This drug is great, however the first two weeks I had trouble staying awake in the morning and at night. I also had trouble waking up in the morning the first week. Once that was over though, I felt like my old self."	2-Mar-09
127562	Phentermine	"At my doctor&#039;s visit on May,21 2017 I was told I have a high blood pressue and high cholestrol and weight 171 lbs. I&#039;m only 29yrs old and 5&#039;3&quot;. I then told my doctor that I want to lose weight. She prescribed me phentermine 30mg, which I take Monday to Friday. After 2 weeks, I&#039;m down to 161lb, lost 10 lbs. I&#039;m excited to see my next result.I feel active and full of energy .My mouth gets dry most of the time so I always carry my water bottle with me. The bad thing about it that I noticed is I&#039;m always mad all the time even with just little things.But...this thing works and I love the changes with my weight loss."	21-Jun-17
71872	Tramadol	"Pulled muscles in lower back from lifting on delivery route. Needed meds I could take during the day while driving. One 50mg in the am with 2 Advil liquidgels &amp; I&#039;m pain free all day. Best side effect has been the clarity to mental processes. Like a cloud has been lifted &amp; my concentration dramatically increased. Focus like I&#039;ve never experienced before &amp; general attitude improvement. Worse side effect is the occasional constipation but that&#039;s what prunes are for. This is my &quot;Limitless&quot; pill from the movie"	19-Jun-16
119780	Ambien CR	"I&#039;ve experienced 12  years of chronic sleep and anxiety disorders. Zolpidem ( &quot;Ambien&quot;) will not &quot;knock you out&quot; or reduce anxiety levels, instead it creates hypnotic effects that have caused me further issues with uncharacteristic night terrors and black outs. As per the warning label, do NOT try to drive / operate heavy machinery while using this medication."	4-Jun-15
140474	Escitalopram	"So I&#039;m on my week three of starting this and I have ups and downs about this mostly ups I have had anxiety for about for five years now never have taken anything for it because I&#039;ve always been afraid of medication but this pill actually helps. The only downfall is I&#039;m on week three right now and I have a little dizziness and the heart palpitations. I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s normal or not I&#039;m going to talk to my doctor about it soon I know. Talking to people is the easiest thing specially with anxiety."	12-May-17
138560	Phentermine	"I was prescribed phentermine/Adipex for weight loss after I discussed with my doctor my lack of energy being a full time single working mother and time and motivation were really my issues contributing to my weight. She said this would give me the motivation and &quot;want&quot; to exercise and is an appetite suppressant. Those two things are very true. I work a desk job and cannot exercise until evening so that is hard. Day 1 and 2 I was on the go all day and felt fantastic, full of energy, and very happy. Day 3 I had several negative side effects of high blood pressure, heart pounding, fatigue, insomnia. Day 4 I had the dose cut in half by my doctor. Today is Friday, day 5, and I have lost 9.5 pounds since Monday. Hoping to see more loss but slower!"	19-Apr-13
142021	Escitalopram	"For the first week on Lexapro, I felt weird; a little lightheaded, dizzy, had insomnia and some minor stomach issues but I stuck it out and I&#039;m so glad I did. I have been taking it for 5 weeks now. I take Lexapro around 10am now as this helps prevent insomnia at night. I feel more energetic, happier and more social. I don&#039;t feel out of control or strange or anything. No side effects now. I would highly recommend it anyone to try this."	16-Jan-09
141717	Escitalopram	"I have been taking Lexapro for about 3 months.  I started off taking 10mg per day but I felt like it wore off throughout the day and my energy level would drop.  My doctor upped the dosage to 20mg and I definitely noticed a difference - my mood doesn&#039;t drop during the day.  I don&#039;t feel sad, I can actually concentrate now.  I haven&#039;t had any side effects, in fact it&#039;s even helped me sleep better.  As for the anxiety, I think it is helping because I&#039;m not as worried about everything all the time but I still feel very stressed out in social situations.  I&#039;m in therapy as well so that might help me learn to control the fear.  Life shouldn&#039;t feel so dire and impossible.  Lexapro helped me see this."	15-Sep-11
64211	Sertraline	"I started off with 25mg for my anxiety &amp; dep. for two weeks and then upped my dose to 50mg First couple of days I felt high anxiety  (probably because I scared myself by reading too much online comments)  For 3-4 weeks I experienced nausea when yawning ( it made me yawn a lot) , no appetite, decrease in sex drive, and hard time reaching an orgasm. Although the side affects seem bad they were bearable. I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t give up. I feel a lot better, my anxiety decreased, my motivation to live increased, I&#039;m a lot happier and I engage into conversations more. I&#039;m very happy for trying Zoloft and can&#039;t wait till it improves my life even more. Try it! It&#039;ll save your life !"	29-Nov-16
204093	Escitalopram	"I was diagnosed,  with a panic disorder. I was always well traveled, worked hard and had a great social life, then my life changed over night. You can&#039;t explain to anyone the feeling of complete helplessness unless you are living it. Anyway long story short Lexapro saved my life, even though could not orgasm while taking it and gained 10 kilos, but I was able too come off it after a year. And now I&#039;m living a normal life again."	20-Feb-14
140926	Escitalopram	"After being on Prozac for 5 years( for PMDD, and general anxiety) I took myself off of it against my Doctors better judgement, and thought I was doing okay until a series of moderate to severe anxiety attacks. I saw my doctor and I was prescribed Escitalopram, and the best thing about it is I have NO OCD recurrences and very little high/low emotional disruption. I am posting this because I&#039;m not a &#039;Poster&#039;, or a frequent flyer on forum sites, but I&#039;ve been off my Escitalopram for about 2 weeks. I ran out and the USPS is taking a little more time than usual to deliver. I&#039;m a MESS. Racing thoughts, crying a lot, fidgety. TOTALLY not like myself when I&#039;m on my meds. Escitalopram is the best for me. Don&#039;t stop taking it without your docs okay."	21-Dec-15
128827	Phentermine	"I am 5&#039;1 and weighed 132 lbs when I started taking Fastin after 3 months I had lost down to 107lbs. I never did exercises and I ate any and everything I wanted and the weight just kept dropping. So to me this is the miracle. I would definitely recommend this to anyone."	12-Oct-14
71690	Tramadol	"Worst stuff around.  Do not take this stuff! Doc started me out with 50 mg two times a day.  Wasn&#039;t relieving my pain, so got pushed to two pills every 6 hrs. It only take away some of the pain. When I wanted to stop taking the pills I went through 4 days of awful withdrawals even though he told me I wouldn&#039;t have them.  I hate that doctor now. I&#039;m going all natural for the pain."	5-Jun-17
141919	Escitalopram	"This has helped me get my life back."	2-Feb-10
138727	Phentermine	"I started taking Adipex July 1. My starting weight was 268 and I lost 12lbs the first week. I have not checked my weight but I&#039;m waiting for my 30 days to see but I notice some differences in my body and the way it looks.  I&#039;m never hungry but I make myself eat three times a day.  I drink a lot of water and I workout now three times a week I never used to work out at all. I love this medicine. It is changing my life, can&#039;t wait to weigh myself."	12-Jul-11
34162	Tramadol	"Tramadol has rather limited positive perceivable impact on opioid-tolerant patients such as myself. Chronic discomfort makes it difficult for me to focus on external tasks, but I do believe this synthetic preparation has a place in late stage rehab where patients are required to slowly step down systemic pain treatment."	2-Jun-09
142003	Escitalopram	"I was on Paxil and switched to Lexapro a few years back (3) and have not had many side affects. It really does calm me down so I have become a nicer person, and shrug off things that I would normally go crazy about, less shouting etc. I take 20mg. I do feel it has made me lazier and as a result I have been putting on some weight as I exercise less. It does affect orgasms which are much harder to pull off and takes incredible effort. I tried 3 times to go off the drug cold turkey, with terrible results. I just became depressed. After a few days I just went back on it again and after 15 minutes felt the glow of calm come into my body and I was &quot;normal&quot; again.  It is addictive, to quit, definitely need to decrease dose gradually."	2-Jun-09
71779	Tramadol	"I&#039;ve been on Tramodol for 6 months for back pain. I can&#039;t take narcotics like codeine, oxycodone, etc, as they make me terribly dizzy and nauseous, as well as give me pounding headaches. But I can take Tramodol without any of those effects. Tramodol also doesn&#039;t give me a &quot;high&quot; like many painkillers, so I&#039;m never tempted to take extra just to get a buzz. I&#039;ve been afraid to go beyond the 150 mg/day prescribed by my doc, but there are days when 150 just doesn&#039;t feel like enough, so I need to talk to my doc about an increase at times. Overall, this med does a fair job at controlling chronic pain without causing side effects. It&#039;s worth trying to see if it will work for you."	26-Dec-16
96980	Ambien	"I have been on Ambien for almost a month now. This drug works maybe a 30 mins later but I do not stay sleep. It gives me maybe a good 6 hours of rest. I&#039;m tired throughout the day but still can&#039;t fall asleep when I get home."	2-Oct-15
128448	Phentermine	"I began taking adipex in 7/31/15.  I weighed in at 204.4 at my annual Gyn appt and was disgusted that I had let myself get that heavy.  I hadn&#039;t weight that much when I was pregnant with my kids.  I am 5&#039;8&quot;.  My goal was to lose 15 pounds by Labor Day.  I was down 17 by that point.  I am now 22.4 pounds down and beginning my last month on it.  I use my fitness pal and try to keep to 1200 calories per day, high in protein.  I generally get in 4-7 miles a day walking and do a 25 minute exercise video 6 days per week.  I am hopeful that I have finally changed my lifestyle.  I needed the jumpstart.  Only side effects early were dry mouth - I drink lots of water.  I plan to cut down to 1/2 pill a day this month.  Love how it&#039;s working."	1-Oct-15
140793	Escitalopram	"I&#039;m a 40yo old male who started Lexapro just over three weeks ago for GAD. The psychiatrist advised 5mg for the first 2 weeks to adjust to side effects, then to 10mg. The first 2 weeks I barely noticed any effect, maybe a little less stressed than usual, but then moving up to 10mg really hit me hard - fatigue, sweats, confusion, nausea, panic attacks. Honestly, 5 days in I was at the point of calling my doctor to say I couldn&#039;t take it anymore. But then on day 6, I woke up feeling a whole lot better. It&#039;s hard to describe but I just feel focused and relaxed in a way that I&#039;d forgotten how, or maybe never knew. I&#039;m now on day 8 at 10mg and am so glad I stuck with it. Talk to you Dr if you&#039;re feeling terrible but know it can get better."	1-Jul-16
97105	Ambien	"I&#039;ve been taking Ambien for almost a month now and I have to say, it is amazing. The first night I took it, it kicked in about 10 minutes later. I have never had such a good nights sleep. I woke up feeling energized and I had energy all day. The only weird thing that I experienced were MILD hallucinations before I actually fell asleep. I sat down on the bed and apparently asked my husband &quot;when did we get a water bed?&quot; (we don&#039;t have a water bed). And also I asked him, &quot;when did we get pink and green sheets?&quot; (Our sheets are white). Other than that, nothing scary or frightening. I didn&#039;t get up in the middle of the night doing anything weird. When I did get up to use the restroom, I knew I was awake and I knew what I was doing."	4-Nov-12
96260	Sertraline	"Was prescribed Zoloft and took sertraline for 6 months after I was having trouble with anxiety/panic attacks from a pretty nasty accident. It worked well after a couple of weeks but eventually I felt that I didn&#039;t need it anymore.  This is my 4th week of weaning off, and the withdrawal is almost unbearable. Dizziness, nausea, exhaustion, seeing weird flashes. I really needed something at the time, so I don&#039;t entirely regret taking it, but the withdrawal is bad."	26-Apr-11
127480	Phentermine	"I started taking these pills last Thursday. Six days later and I have already lost 9 lbs..... My appetite is pretty much non existent I have been eating 1 meal per day and and I usually have a protein shake as a meal replacement. The first 2-3 days I didn&rsquo;t sleep at all now the only symptom I have is dry mouth. I plan on taking this medicine for as long as my doctor will allow me to. SW 238, CW 229 ,GW 170"	27-Sep-17
71853	Tramadol	"I was prescribed Tramadol for back pain because I am allergic to NSAIDs. I was taking two 50mg tablets per day and noticed that my mental state also improved while taking this medication. My anxiety subsided and I found that I did not get upset even in stressful situations (I work in HR which is very stressful for me). It&#039;s been a miracle for me since I deal with anxiety issues almost daily. It puts me in state of calm, but I&#039;m still me. The only side effects I&#039;ve experienced while taking Tramadol have been entirely positive. I wish it was prescribed for anxiety disorders."	2-Mar-16
140709	Escitalopram	"This med besides Effexor is the only one which can handle my destructive anxiety and depressiom without making me sleepy and tired through the day. Actually, i don&#039;t feel tired at all! I&#039;m sleeping 4 hours per night and waking up really energetic. Migraines, wet hands, suicide thougts   body ache, tingling fingers, shortness of breath... all gone.  Side effects were: increased appetite, retarded ejaculation, sinusitis, skin problem (bearable). After a month, just the ejaculation problems persists"	12-Oct-16
128236	Phentermine	"Hi, I&#039;m 31 female. Just shy of 5&#039;4. I started phentermine on 12/28/15 weighing 184, now I&#039;m in the middle of my 9th week and I weigh 165, so in 2 months I lost 19lbs, my goal is 145. I weigh in at my clinic every Monday evening. I do cardio &amp; weights 4 to 6 days a week. The first 3 weeks I ate strictly protein and veggies with some fat, I&#039;ve slowly added in complex carbs and fruit. I drink at least 90oz of water a day and have 3 meals and 2-3 snacks, the days I don&#039;t work out only eat the 2 snacks. The side effects I&#039;ve had are dry mouth, dry skin and constipation (despite my water and fiber intake). I recommend the smooth moves tea by traditional medicinals, but test it one a day where you can be near a bathroom so you know how you react."	24-Feb-16
64126	Sertraline	"I had depression and anxiety since 2 years . Tried prozac and from 3rd pill it was terrible ! Severe headache ! Changed to zoloft and started increasing dose gradually from 12.5 till 25 then 50 . Noticed improvement in about 1-2 month . I recommend this drug . Tried to stop it 2 month ago and I relapsed so am taking it now again hoping it could work again .. However my insomnia is killing me !!!!"	14-Apr-17
64858	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve tried a lot of other medications for my depressions an anxiety and they made me feel sick to my stomach. So I would stick to it. I was to busy trying push through my duties as a mother and wife. I couldn&#039;t feel sick to my stomach plus depression &amp; anxiety. So when the Dr gave me Zoloft I was hesitant. I did take it the first day and I slept really well  with NO drowsiness the next morning. I felt happy and focused. I was able to do the simple things like figure out what to cook for dinner. I have energy and a clear mind. I started with 50mg but I think I was getting used to it. So I started taking 100mg and so far so good! My husband notices a difference and loves it. It wouldn&#039;t hurt to at least to try it. I&#039;m sooooo glad I did."	5-May-15
138795	Phentermine	"I just started taking phentermine yesterday 2/8/2011.  When I weighed myself yesterday morning the scale said 273.0 I took the pill and my appetite was completely gone. I ate a very small breakfast and had to force myself to eat anything for lunch.  When dinner came I wasn&#039;t hungry but I figured I should eat something.  I drank 9 bottles of water because my mouth was so dry.  I didn&#039;t have any issues sleeping and I didn&#039;t notice any change in my energy level. When I woke up this morning I headed straight to the scale and I&#039;d already lost 3lbs. The scale said 270.8.  I&#039;m very excited and super motivated to continue."	9-Feb-11
141228	Escitalopram	"Lexapro is great. I started when my panic attacks and depression made me unable to function at all and I was too afraid to leave my house. My thoughts would race and I was just a mess. I started on 5mg for a week which was like nothing but then upped to 10mg and after 3 weeks I was beginning to feel less anxious and more stable. After 6 weeks I&#039;d say I felt normal. I&#039;m going to try come off them after being on them for a year and a half. I haven&#039;t had a panic attack in over a year so for panic disorder they work fantastically well. I&#039;ve experienced no side effects with this drug."	29-May-15

72500	Tramadol	"I was taking 3-4 Lortab&#039;s a day 7.5 for 2 years for chronic low back pain. My new Doctor won&#039;t write narcotics for chronic pain, so he gave me Ultram 25mg. I was worried about withdrawal from Lortab, but I had none, zero, I don&#039;t know how I just didn&#039;t because I have run out in the past and had withdrawals. I like Ultram. I take it less than the Lortab and it works just as well. I think Lortab &quot;made&quot; my body hurt so I would take more of it (if that makes sense). I need 50mg sometimes 100mg to get relief and I can not take Ultram ER. If you are taking that, that may be why you are having dizzy spells ... it made my vertigo crazy!"	26-Mar-11
72609	Tramadol	"A doctgor (I&#039;ve been to many) tried me on Ultram.  On about the 2nd or 3rd day, I was at work and began feeling very strange.  I got shakier as the morning progressed.  I got up and could not walk without holding on to the wall.  Then I began having breathing problems.  I asked my boss if somebody could take me to the ER.  On the way there, I truly felt like I was going to die.  My coworker got me into the ER and the triage team first checked my heart out with an ECG, etc.  The conclusion the ER doctor came up with is that I was having something called Serotonin Syndrome which can be quite serious.  They gave me some Ativan and sent me home.  My mother-in-law was on Ultram for years and it worked very well for her."	20-May-10
141089	Escitalopram	"This medicine absolutely almost ruined my life, to the point I was going to lose EVERYTHING.  It made me nauseous,  tired,  loss of sex drive , made me want to drink 24/7 all because I DIDN&#039;T CARE ANYMORE!  I lost 2 jobs, because I had no desire to function basically.  I have been off it for 2 weeks now now and the side effects from coming off this medication is not bad at all.  I feel happy again,  a little anxiety but omg I&#039;ll deal with it the natural way. ...exercise or just enjoy my family again.  "	14-Oct-15
141167	Escitalopram	"I suffer from generalized anxiety and frequent panic attacks. Been on the medication for a week now. First 6 days 5 mg, now its been upped to 10 mg. Definitely has taken the edge off, but I&#039;m in a daze/dream like state. Gonna stick it out and give it a few more weeks. Better and more stabilized mood.  Also, side effect of bad stomach pains and bathroom issues. Hoping thats also resolved soon."	25-Aug-15
141355	Escitalopram	"My Anxiety symptoms before Lexapro  I was always paranoid of people judging me and just wasn&#039;t myself because I always felt panicked.  I would socially isolate myself from friends and family, which then drove me into depression.  My anxiety inhibited myself from learning and grasping new knowledge because I was too anxious to even learn.  Even doing the smallest tasks (paying bills) would cause an overwhelming amount of anxiety.    Now (after 4 weeks on 10 mg)  - I&#039;m mellow, feel confident. Someone I just met pegged me as an intellect! God knows how long anxiety has made me doubt my intelligence.  I&#039;m able to do tasks easier, which has reduced my procrastination.  It hasn&#039;t completely reduced my depression, but Im thinking of trying 20 mg."	4-Nov-14
127685	Phentermine	"I originally started this on January 8, 2016 at a weight of 223 lbs. and ended it sometime around August 2016. I started with 15mg and increased to 30mg then decreased to come off of it. I lost over 60 pounds during that time and then lost a little more after coming off of the medication. I maintained my weight with a 5 lb fluctuation. Just recently (Feb. 2017) I was put back on the medication to help me drop weight before possible surgery. I was instantly put on 30mg. I started at 160 lbs and as of today I&#039;m at 145 lbs. The goal is to be at 130-135 lbs.   I haven&#039;t had any bad side affects other than random bursts of energy, dry mouth, the nasty taste in my mouth, And the lack of bowel movements."	9-Apr-17
140539	Escitalopram	"My only regret is not taking this sooner in life. I suffered with anxiety as well as PMDD that disrupted my life and marriage frequently.  I had tried Cipralex previously but was scared off because I started at full dosage. Upon the guidance of my pharmacist I started 5mg for two weeks and then went up to 10.   Side effects were minor and went away after a month or so.  I still have some difficulty climaxing and may start taking Wellbutrin as well to negate this.   Otherwise I am a happy, carefree confident person. I&#039;m social, I have no more social anxiety and very little anxiety in general. I am calm and don&#039;t sweat the small things. I hope this continues to work for me."	3-Jan-17
71852	Tramadol	"I&#039;ve been on tramadol 50 my 3x day for 7 years now for arthritis. It&#039;s a very good pain relief it also helps sleep good an helps with my anxiety issues. But my tolerance level started to get high after a year of taking it. It stop working good so I had to start taking four a day, then ended up finding out I&#039;m having withdrawal symptoms which is VERY TERRIBLE thing to go through. I suggest if anyone taking this... *WARNING* if u feel like it not working anymore and you&#039;ve been taking it for a long period of time stop taking them that means your getting addicted. Or just take a break from taking them for a bit. Went through hell with the withdrawal from those."	3-Mar-16
128519	Phentermine	"I started phentermine on 7/24/15 at 379.5lbs. Today I weighed in at 363. For a total loss of 16.5lbs in 7 days. The first day I was extremely nauseous, highly energetic, cranky and had dry mouth. The dry mouth and crankiness went away after the first day. I generally eat 2-300 calories and a 300 calorie protein shake with 52g of protein. I supplement with various vitamins and work out. I am hoping to lose another 10 in the next month. Overall I am not even slightly hungry although my disgust for food is starting to wain. Example of meal: Half a piece of cheese, one turkey slice, half a cracker; then I am done. Hoping I can tolerate 2 protein shakes by next week. Working great so far."	30-Jul-15
128169	Phentermine	"I am 46/F/305 lbs......I just started premiere weight loss center yesterday.I am doing 500 cal right now, phentermine 37.5 daily, and get weekly b-complex injections......I tried this back in 2011, had great success, lost 60lbs in about 4 months.....due to a shoulder injury and surgery, had to stop...was layed up for 18 months, ugh......then I changed jobs, got divorce...life got in the way, lol. So today is my first day back on it...the phen has started working immediately already...I&#039;m having to force myself to eat...I think I&#039;m going to try some high protein, low cal shakes....easier for my lifestyle as well....I&#039;m in the nursing field and always on the go. I hate water, but love Dt coke...will check in after 1st weigh in 4/22!!!"	16-Apr-16
141542	Escitalopram	"I have been taking 10 mgs. Lexapro now for two months for depression and anxiety. I hope I never have to stop.  I started feeling better the first day and it hasn&#039;t let up. This has made me feel as good as I did 15 years ago. (Previously it was a slow, steady decline). There are definitely side effects: for me there have been pretty serious fatigue and near-total loss of appetite. I will use weight gain supplements to stop the weight loss if I have to (I already weigh 107 lbs., down from 115lbs), but I&#039;m not sure what to do about the fatigue other than drink more coffee. (I should also note that this medicine completely solved my sleeping problem, literally the first night. I used to never sleep; now I sleep 7 hours. A miracle for me!)."	27-Aug-13
95743	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been on Zoloft for the past four months and it&#039;s worked great! I&#039;d been on 3 other medications before that and none of them have worked as well as Zoloft when it&#039;s coupled with 15mg of Buspar and 20mg of Adderall. My anxiety has dropped, my mood has improved dramatically, and I&#039;ve even lost weight, which I haven&#039;t been able to do since I recovered from my eating disorder. Unfortunately I think I&#039;m going to have to have my dosage upped because of my Seasonal Affective Disorder, but otherwise it&#039;s worked very well."	11-Nov-14
127502	Phentermine	"I started on this medication back in February of 2017.  I weighed in at 219 +/-.  I had a few side effects [constipation slight] took some over the counter medicine and all is good.  I didn&#039;t see anything at first, it took about 1 1/2 months.  But to date I have lost 31 lbs.  I don&#039;t really notice it looking at myself [I rarely do, as I have been disgusted with my weight issues and how I just really let myself go] but different co-workers noticed that my face was thinner.  Then I noticed that my tops were looking like I was drowning.  All in all, this has been a positive, and I would recommend.  Thank you~"	3-Sep-17
142109	Escitalopram	"I have been on lexapro for a week and it&#039;s been a ride. I have had horrible side effects from the start. Really bad headaches, night sweats, frequent suicidal thoughts. It has had an opposite effect on me. My depression/anxiety are worse. I sleep way too much. I also have experienced loss of appetite while a lot of people gain weight. I&#039;ve lost 9 pounds in a week, which is really weird because my weight has been the same for years. I never really gain or lose so I know it&#039;s the medicines. I&#039;m hoping that all the bad side effects will pass. I don&#039;t want to give up on the drug yet. I&#039;m going to at least try and stick it out for a month."	27-Feb-09
127579	Phentermine	"I started Phentermine 3 weeks ago after the doc advised me that my BMI classified me as &quot;obese.&quot;  Many people would probably not consider me &quot;obese&quot; in the traditional sense.  I am 6&#039;1, male, and three weeks ago I weighed in at 228 pounds.  Today, I am down to 207 pounds.  I work out with a trainer 3 times a week (but also did this before going on Phentermine, and was hitting a plateau). I am trying to get down to 185 and will probably hit it by September.  Question for everyone: My appetite completely disappeared the first three weeks, but it has now slowly started coming back ONLY in the evening (usually around 8 or 9pm).  Has anyone else experienced the hunger returning in the evenings at this stage?"	22-Jul-17
142115	Escitalopram	"I am a female, 29 years old and have never battled depression until my dad passed away. My crying and irritablity just getting worse as months went on. I have been on Lexapro for only 2 days but I have noticed a difference in my mood. The very first day I felt a &quot;high&quot;, &quot;weird&quot; sense. It made me sleepy but then restless in the middle of the night BUT I have been already feeling better mood-wise. I am going to try and tough it out because I have more good than bad. We&#039;ll see!"	6-Feb-09
140979	Escitalopram	"As my nickname says I have been very quiet and most of my life. Always worried and anxious since a child, I came to the US when on my 30s and years later, I think the stresses of life and my personality put me in a severe anxiety with depression and several panic attacks. I was thinking I would die!. Went to Psychiatrist did not trust on him first time, I did not want to take the medicine and I got worse! I started taking lexapro 10 mg, it helped me so much, I had that hope on it that I didn&#039;t remember side effects. I used also the benzodizepines and ambien to be calmer and get some sleep. Like 3 months later didn&#039;t take more benzo ,and/or ambien. I have been in this medicine since March 2014, today is March 2016. Been reduced now to half"	22-Mar-16
140894	Escitalopram	"I have been taking this medication only recently for my anxiety/ depression. I&#039;ve recently suffered the loss of a baby and was having a very difficult time. For 4-5 months I had no appetite, nausea, headaches, fever, what felt like the never ending flu/cold. The first time taking this was at night and I didn&#039;t notice much change however the next time I took it in the AM...BAD idea! I am not much of a breakfast person so perhaps that tied into it as well but it made me so sick I had to leave work. Since then I have been taking it later in the day (dinner time) and I have been feeling much better, we&#039;ll see how it goes as time goes on :)"	25-Jan-16
71692	Tramadol	"Was prescribed for knee injury. I tried all sorts of SSRI,  SDRI , tricyclics,  etc. for unexplained depression. All of them had side affects so detrimental that it made me more depressed. Of course the so called doctors want to give you more drugs to counter the side affects all the while claiming your a border line heroin addict all the while having no idea what is causing the depression all the while suggesting it&#039;s all just maligned thought processes.Thank goodness I have arthritic knees. After taking tramadol by depression is gone . Fact. Every patient is different. Don&#039;t be pigeon holed.  I have been taking one 50mg per day for years. Works somehow. If it is placebo then why didn&#039;t all the other Meds work the same. For once I&#039;d like to hear a Doctor just say &quot; i dont know."	3-Jun-17
64982	Sertraline	"I have been struggling with social anxiety disorder and a low-level functioning depression for most of my life. Four years went by with no medication, and during this time I was very paranoid and lost all of my friends. It wasn&#039;t until I met my boyfriend that I saw I couldn&#039;t truly function this way. I finally admitted to myself that I might need to be on medication. It&#039;s been about two months and I feel awesome. I am taking 50mg everyday, and was able to go on a Christmas vacation where my boyfriend and I met each other&#039;s families. This would never have been doable before. I am thoroughly satisfied, and am so happy with my decision. I still have leftover anxiety symptoms but I am working on that in therapy."	5-Jan-15

138904	Phentermine	"I just started the pill (phentermine 37.50) a week ago. I love that I don&#039;t feel hungry. I don&#039;t have any side effects other than a dry mouth.  I do have high blood pressure and my pressure has been fine.  I take it first thing in the morning so that it won&#039;t keep me up at night.  I started at 200lbs and I am 5&#039;7&quot; and now I am 192.5 pounds, a loss of 7.5lbs in 1 week.  I do work out about 4 times a week and I just started to eat more salads and I still do eat pizza once in a while.  My appetite has really decreased and sometime I have to make myself eat. I still drink red wine twice a week. I am trying to reach 140lbs.  I will continue to post to this site.  I drink water all the time but I need to anyway."	1-May-10
128137	Phentermine	"I started Adipex 37.5 a week ago today 04-07-2016 and I have gained 3 pounds??? I don&#039;t understand why it&#039;s not working I&#039;m using my fitness pal to help track my meals but the most I get out of these is a headache and I&#039;m very moody. I called my doctor but today is Saturday to see why I haven&#039;t been so successful as the others that I have been reading about my start date was 268.5 when I weighed myself today and 272 I&#039;m so disappointed I paid $100 for the pills in Detroit, Michigan and my repeat visits are $75.  I am not hungry but very gasy. I eat 3 meals per day and have not worked out yet."	8-May-16
140790	Escitalopram	"Only took 2.0 mg first time &amp; 2.0 mg in evening.  So 4mg altogether daily.  Instant relief upon first dose.  Immediate. Gave me headache first dose for about 3 hours but after that all good for 3 days.  On 4th day got another headache in evening for few hours.  Last night took it at about 10pm, got to sleep but woke up at 4am couldn&#039;t get bk to sleep til 7am.  Gives u vivid dreams that feel real.  I wouldn&#039;t recommend starting with any more than 2.5mg or 4mg max split in two doses at least 8-10-12 hrs apart. 2.0mg each dose max. I&#039;m thinking of making my evening dose just 1mg or bc it&#039;s much stronger and more of an upper than celexa. Does makes u feel tired but the anxiety is gone, less hypersensitive but can be too &#039;high&#039; agitating."	19-Aug-16
141440	Escitalopram	"Just started my 3rd month on this medication and I have never been so happy in my life. I struggled with major anxiety and periods of depression that had affected my school work and social life, I would never want to go out with my friends. I also felt as if everyone was talking about my issue and was trying to avoid me as to not get involved. I would like to call this prescription a miracle because it has helped me in ways that I cannot explain. I was feeling so helpless and felt like I had no control over my life. After the second week or taking the medicines I started to feel like the normal me. I did experience some slightly unpleasant side effects such as dry mouth and insomnia in the first 3 or 4 days, but they got better."	11-Dec-13
140468	Escitalopram	"I started Cipralex on Jan 9 2017 after a bad collapse due to anxiety. I was not able to eat, lost 20 lbs, had panic attacks. I started with 5mg daily for one week, increased it to 10mg daily for one month, and increased it again to 15mg for 3 weeks. Now I have been taking 20mg for almost 3 months which seem to be the right dose for me.  I had minor side effect in the 1st couple weeks, change of sleeping habits, a bit of diarrhea but my body seem to have adjusted. In one sentence Cipralex changed my life. I am a better version of who I used to be. I gained 15lbs in 6 weeks (much needed, I am 130 lbs now). My appetite is back to normal, no more abdominal problems. Only downside is the hangovers even if I only have 2 drinks."	18-May-17
138852	Phentermine	"When I first started taking this medication, I lost 13lbs in the first month! I was very surprised at the results, as was my doctor, and I had little side effects. I did not do anything other than work at my job place, no extra exercise.  After that month, I stopped the medication. Now I am 25lbs bigger than I was before I lost the 13lbs. I am back to taking it, but am not doing as good as I had before. It may be because, my husband and I miscarried our 1st child in the 7th week of pregnancy.  This may have changed the way my body reacts to things. Although it was a hard time, I didn&#039;t overeat after that. I ate better to get healthier if I become pregnant again, so the gain in weight was not from overeating. I hope to see better results soon."	7-Sep-10
72530	Tramadol	"I got Restless Leg Syndrome and severe lower back pain due to a horrific car accident. Tramodol made me sick so I had to stop. I have tried all the medicines you can think off, even the ones for epilepsy and anti-seizure drugs. The only thing that gives me relief from the RLS and chronic back pain is slow release morphine. Have now been on it since 1991. If people and doctors knew what living with the RLS and chronic pain is like, they would never doubt or disbelieve you again. Imagine not being able to sit or sleep or lie still anywhere or anytime, forget sleeping at nite, until you are just so physically exhausted and drained from having to move your legs constantly 24hrs a day. It&#039;s awful."	1-Mar-10
71810	Tramadol	"Was given Tramadol for back pain and stiffness, then realized it helped my RLS. Now my doctor wants me off of it because she said that it is not known to treat RLS. I was taking two tablets in the evening. Now she has me trying Ropinirole HCL. I am recovering from a hip replacement and doing so well until my doctor took me off the Tramadol, now I am exhausted and feel like I am not progressing with recovery. Don&#039;t want to go anywhere or do anything. If I was taking 200 tablets a week, I could understand their concern, but I am taking 14 tablets a week. After reading everyone&#039;s comments, I plan on talking to my doctor to inform her that there are people using Tramadol with success. Maybe there is hope!"	26-Aug-16
138931	Phentermine	"I&#039;ve been taking Phentermine since Aug 09, for about 3 months now and I&#039;ve lost 30 lbs. It&#039;s helped me lose about 10lbs a month. First two months I didn&#039;t exercise with it. This month it has been the first time I exercised with it and it even helps more. Extra lbs come off with exercise, but just taking the pill alone does fine. When I do feel hungry and I start eating I don&#039;t eat as much as I think I&#039;m going to. Normally it&#039;s a few bites and I&#039;m already full. It also gives me a lot of energy, so not only does this drug help me lose weight but it also helps with my procrastination on everything."	20-Nov-09

139084	Phentermine	"I have been taking adipex since january 7 and it is now march 13. I have lost 36 lbs. I exercise everyday for an hour of cardio, drink plenty of water, and watch my diet. I recommend it to anyone with a weight problem. I started at 305 and now at 269 lbs. Only side effect I feel is lots of energy and I get about 6 hours of sleep a night,which is good. It&#039;s a miracle pill with work and effort."	13-Mar-09
78437	Allegra	"It seemed to me the reviews here were overly negative for Allegra.  For me, Allegra has the fewest side effects. I&#039;ve never had any drowsiness issues with Allegra.I have noticed that it takes about two hours to get the maximum benefit although starts to work in 20 minutes.  It does lose potency after 7-8 hours.  I sometimes cut the pills in half so can you extend the effect a little longer. It does provide excellent relief.  For extreme pollen levels, I think Zyrtec or Xyzal are a little stronger. But, I would try this because it seems to less side effects if you have not been a regular antihistamine user."	19-Jul-16
71951	Tramadol	"I was prescribed Tramadol 50 mg for headaches and TMJ pain.  However, the biggest difference this medication has made for me is the way it has helped my anxiety and depression.  It is truly amazing, and a blessing.  I have severe social anxiety but I find now that I can talk to people and actually want to socialize.  No other med has really ever helped me.  I truly wish that doctors understood how this medication helps those of us with long-standing anxiety and depression, it&#039;s a miracle."	1-Jul-15
95905	Sertraline	"I have been on Zoloft (sertraline) for a little over a year. It has made a huge difference in my quality of life - I no longer have constant anxiety or am paralyzed by inability to make a decision. I was afraid that it would make me feel like a zombie or feel emotionless, but instead I just feel much more in control and able to move on from things like a normal person.  I was worried about weight gain on this, but my doc combined it with Wellbutrin to help with my depression and offset the Zoloft side effects, and it turned out to be a perfect combo!"	15-Oct-13
139012	Phentermine	"I am 25 years of age and my weight has always been an issue. After I had my old son, now 8 months old, I got up to 300 lbs. I didn&#039;t want to get any higher. This was the kicker. I want to live a long healthy life and be able to interact with my son as he grows. I started Phentermine 37.5mg on June 10th and by the 24th I have lost 22 lbs. It has been hard I will admit. I&#039;ve always been an emotional eater, never alcohol or smoking and of course no illegal drug use. Food has been my comfort all my life pretty much. Now I am just trying to find out what to replace that comfort with. I admit I haven&#039;t even exercised and I need to do so. I am planning on walking today and I&#039;m going to absolutely have to stick with it. That&#039;s going to be the hard part."	29-Jun-09
34365	Tramadol	"I have been using tramadol for 7 years for chronic regional pain syndrome. It works really well and I don&#039;t get any side effects except occasional itching.

128465	Phentermine	"OK, Ladies, I felt obliged to report my progress on Adipex. I started my weight loss regimen 6-29-15 weighing 275 and size 20-22. I went for my weigh in on 9-17-15, I am now 238 and size 14... You do the math.. It hasn&#039;t even been 3 whole months and I&#039;m loving my new body.. I simply paid more attention to the things I was eating.. Note: Do not deprive yourself, just eat in moderation.I got my gym membership and started going 5-6 a week.. I look forward to working out now. I have so much energy now that I&#039;m lighter. My husband just took me to get a brand new wardrobe because nothing was fitting. I get so many compliments now my collages, family and friends are amazed. I wanted to encourage someone out there....you can do it!!"	22-Sep-15
63975	Sertraline	"After taking Zoloft (50 mg) for only a few days, I feel incredibly lucky to have had such a positive experience with it. For about an hour after I take it I get stomach cramps that resemble menstrual cramps, but after that I go into a really positive mood and I just want to tell everybody how much I appreciate them. I don&#039;t get sick from overthinking minor details anymore and all of my emotions feel more stable and controllable. I&#039;m experiencing slight restlessness and difficulty falling asleep, but I&#039;m taking that as a positive, as I feel like I got my energy back. I do clench my jaw at night now though. I have no appetite and I&#039;m losing weight, but I used to overeat due to anxiety so I don&#039;t mind it. I never thought I could be this happy."	26-Jun-17
97280	Ambien	"I started taking Ambien about 3 years ago.  When I first took it I did make the random phone calls and would eat in my sleep but it worked.  I only took it when I absolutely needed to.  I stopped for about a year then the insomnia started again and I took it again and the side effects weren&#039;t there.  I still take it every once in a while when I really need it (maybe once a month) and the side effects are still gone. Just sleep and I don&#039;t feel groggy in the morning."	11-Oct-08

This drug was extremely encouraging after being stuck in a weight loss rut.Drink tons of water,you do not want to dehydrate on this! Be very aware of mood changes and addiction."	11-May-08

I had even had started cutting myself worse than ever. Plus a lot that can&#039;t be explained not like any other time and I know I&#039;ve been in hospital more than a couple of times.

I already eat pretty healthy and exercise everyday for about 2 hours but I was not losing any weight. I had a friend that was on it and lost about 50 pounds so I thought I would give it a go. I got a small headache like one or two times, I still sleep really well. I went from 2011 to currently 196, a total of 15 pounds in one month. I&#039;m hoping to lose about 50 pounds so I could get at a good weight. I bike ride everyday and run but since I&#039;m starting my second month of dosage I am going to work on ab workouts and lifting so I can try to get toned. I&#039;ll make an update soon!"	29-Jun-15

I started on phentermine 37.5 on may 18 2015 I also got the b12 double shot which I paid an additional $20 for I get these every 7 to 10 days. On May 28 my weight went from 274 to 261 ,,that&#039;s 13 lbs lost. I exercised 3-4 days I am not changing my eating habits drastically but I am eating better phentermine helps a lot.

64267	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been meaning to post my positive review of Zoloft for a while. This past summer I suffered probably the worst social anxiety I had ever encountered in my life. I had started a new job where I was expected to speak to others on a daily basis. It was gut wrenching. I fell apart, crying, screaming, and forcing myself to go to work. Even when I was at work I would hide in the bathroom and pee incessantly out of nervousness. Finally I found a good psychiatrist and got back on Zoloft. I had been on Zoloft 50mg earlier in the year, but stopped because I feared it might affect my fertility. After meeting with the shrink I was upped to 200 mgs gradually. Since then I have been so happy and full of life. This drug really has worked for me."	16-Dec-16

I suffered with the worst anxiety and I was MISERABLE. I had panic attacks that sent me to the ER..I was too scared to drive, missed weeks of work and literally did not leave the house. I suffered through it until I had the baby. After, my doctor put me on Lexapro. After a few weeks, I felt 100% better. I can&#039;t begin to explain the change I had felt. I was able to do things without thinking the worst of everything. Before I started taking it, it depressed me because I thought I was going to feel that way forever and always have to deal with anxiety. Now, I live a normal life!"	6-Jun-12
141169	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve been taking this medicine for 8 days. I feel ok. No significant side effects so far. I havent cried once since Ive been on it, and honestly i dont know if i even can anymore. So far so good. I would say its too early to tell if this is the &quot;one&quot;. Im on 5 mg only. I take this for a anxiety disorder and slight depression. Dont be afraid to try this one. I was really scared and worried that Ive made a bad decision. If i didnt take this Id be crying everyday...so this has helped. Fingers crossed on continuing no side effects!"	1-Jul-15
96124	Sertraline	"2 months on Sertraline and it WORKS! Read horror stories online but decided to give it a shot. Started at 25MG for 1 week, 50mg for 2 weeks and now 100mg. I was the type of person that was SO negative and upset. Always down and feeling sorry for myself, something bad happens and it&#039;s the end of the world.  Sex drive-HA! What sex drive?  When I first began I had bad headaches even my first migraine, dry mouth and a constant yawn-those didn&#039;t last that long, maybe a week or 2. Now I&#039;m happy, much more positive, I feel good about myself and I&#039;m grateful for what I have.  My sex drive has returned although it is difficult to orgasm. It&#039;s worth it though. Peace of Mind at last."	7-Dec-11
127844	Phentermine	"I took phenermine 2 years ago, and within the first month I lost 36 pounds and not a flabby loss. I was weighing in at 283 6&#039; 1&quot; and 30 days later on my check up I weighed in @ 247. I ran 6 miles on the elliptical and still did my body workouts. I had just quit smoking and cut my calorie intake to 1800 per day. At the end of three months I weighed in @ 229. The only side effects I had were cotton mouth and constipation but that&#039;s because I didn&#039;t drink a lot of water. It&#039;s a great pill to help you get to your goal, also Lets just say the wife was pleased!!! I hope this helps you achieve what you are looking for!!!!!"	3-Jan-17
127552	Phentermine	"In 2012 I was about 225 pounds, I had high blood pressure but I think that was brought on by RA(since 2007), I finally asked my doctor, the new endocrinologist at the local medical group who diagnosed my hypothyroidism too. If she could prescribe something to help me. I started 12/19/2012 and with diet, exercise and phentermine I went from 217 to 155 (62 pounds) by 11/30/13. It was work, but phentermine cut my appetite to zero and boosted my energy to 10. I never felt sick and as long as you don&#039;t take it after like noon you won&#039;t have sleep issues."	1-Jul-17
127519	Phentermine	"I am now on my 3rd month of Adipex. I started June at 190 and currently at 166.4lb I still get the dry mouth and had two episodes of getting blurred vision, clammy feeling and passing out and than throw up. Well today I figured out the common factor of each time that happened. I had one alcoholic beverage each of those days. So lesson learned even 1 little drink with this medication can cause major side effects. Other than that I have been totally fine. So I chalked it up to human error!!! Hoping to keep the weight off when my 3 months are up. Well check back on my last day for final results of 3 months."	20-Aug-17
141386	Escitalopram	"I have experienced horrible panic attacks and anxiety my whole life but went unnoticed until a major breakdown this summer. I was unable to sleep, had panic attacks at work and could barely function. I had thoughts of doom and my emotions were out of control. The anxiety lead to depression and it felt like my life was spinning out of control.  I have since sought help and am doing great on 10mg of Lexapro and 1 mg Klonpin for anxiety. My moods are also better, worrysome thoughts are under control.  I highly recommend this medication to anyone suffering from anxiety and depression."	11-Sep-14
140725	Escitalopram	"I got this prescribed for frequent panic attacks and anxiety. All this medicine did for me was create a much bigger sense of anxiety. I should have know the first time I took this to never take it again, but I knew I needed to try it out for longer in hopes it would work. Immediately after I would take this my anxiety would worsen and after it settled I would experience uncontrollable panic attacks lasting over 2 hours. I do not recommend if you are incapable of waiting over a month with this being a possible side effect when taking it."	8-Aug-16
128695	Phentermine	"I started last month I was wearing 215.. I&#039;m now down too 206.. Could have lost more but I did miss 2 weeks. So that messed me up.. But I&#039;m excited and about too really hit the gym too see how much more I can loss.. Soo 2 more month... They really do work. I feel better.. Just dry mouth that&#039;s it."	29-Apr-15
96370	Sertraline	"I started taking half pill for the first 7 days. I only lasted 3 days and had to remove myself from it. The first day I took the pill in the morning and felt fine other then being wide awake. That night I was restless and could not sleep. The next day I spent the entire day feeling like I was buzzing around. Like I had chugged a energy drink that never wore off. That night I again couldn&#039;t sleep but when I did catch an hours worth I had crazy dreams. Doctor pulled me off the drug the next day. I made it through the night thanks to Ativan that night. The search continues for the right prescription. But after those side effects, I seriously contemplate just dealing with my issues without medicine. Anxiety is a pain, but tolerable."	10-Feb-10
188915	Aspirin / caffeine	"I recommend it as the best to alleviate pain.  Better than Oxicodone which lasts 1/2 hour.    Forget Tylenol.  As a dance teacher I experience all kinds of aches and pains .  Have had disk problems, hip replacement and taken every pain killer known.    For me this is the best anti-inflammatory.  Most drs. for some unknown reason never heard of Anacin don&#039;t know what I am taking.  I am going for minor surgery in a few days and still taking. Will quit 3 days before.  I take with coffee, milk, water etc.  Takes about one hour to take effect and I do take right before going to sleep."	20-Aug-16
72596	Tramadol	"I have horrible Restless Legs Syndrome. Not just in my legs, and not just when I&#039;m trying to sleep; I experience a horrible tension in my limbs all day. Tramadol (Ultram) completely cured it. Also, I experience chronic pain from an old injury, and Ultram is the only NON-OPIATE medication that actually helps my pain."	13-Jul-10
97092	Ambien	"Since I was a teenager I have been struggling with Insomnia. So I was sent to a Psychiatrist who was fairly old. So as he prescribed Xanax and Valium for me in the day time. He gave me Amytal (amobarbital) 200mg Capsules for insomnia. These work more than you can believe. However as there wasn&#039;t a huge demand for it it was taken off the market, and I was put on Restoril 30mg x 2,  didn&#039;t work. Ambien in my opinion is the best they have on the market right now. "	23-Apr-13
141229	Escitalopram	"Lexapro or Cipralex, as sold on the Romanian market did a great job on me. Depression, lack of focus and anxiety had me down and couldn&#039;t find my way out and live the life again. The doctor prescribed me 10 mg daily, started with 5 the first week and a small dose of xanax. I noticed the effects within days. A more positive outlook, could do and organize my life,  more focus and better sleep, more energy. I didn&#039;t had any side effects, or maybe just positive ones:stopped overeating (anxiety eating) and drinking ( I was starting to feel like an alcoholic because I used alcohol to stop my restless mind). It made a big difference."	27-May-15
128095	Phentermine	"Female 40yrs old, 5&#039;3&quot;. I&#039;ve started phentermine 37.5mg Friday July 8, 2016. Starting weight 200.4.  Today July 10, 2016, I am down to 196.4. I&#039;ve lost 4 pounds. I&#039;m sure is water weight, as I&#039;ve increased my water intake my 90%. It suppresses my appetite, but couldn&#039;t sleep first night. I find to get a headache mid afternoon 2-3pm. I take it at 830am. Take Excedrin, and all is well. I&#039;d like to get to 170 first goal, 160 2nd goal, and then finally 150. So far those are the only side effects I&#039;m experiencing. I&#039;m not counting calories, but am watching what I eat and drink only water, and exercise hr 3 days week, plus daily housework. I also have a kitten that&#039;s very hyper and keeps me active. LoL. Good luck to everyone&#039;s weight loss!"	10-Jul-16
138518	Phentermine	"So far it has been amazing! I will write back in 3 months with a very detailed review."	29-May-13
96094	Sertraline	"I started Zoloft 2 weeks ago for obsessive compulsive disorder. At first I hated the thought of being on a medicine that controls your mood at the age of 19. Anxiety went up like crazy when I first started at 50mg, and I was thinking this is not going to work, and that I should just get off the medicine. I stayed on strong with hope and 2 days ago I woke up feeling like my old self! I had a lot of energy, I did not have any anxiety at all, the racing thoughts in my head were gone to the point where I felt awesome! My old self is back within 2 weeks because of Zoloft. If you are concerned about this medicine, try it for at least a month if not longer, it gave me great results so far with no side effects, and it can do the same for you."	5-May-12
141014	Escitalopram	"Stay away from this drug! Or at least if you have had my experience. My side effects was that I had very painful armpit boils. Never before in my life had I had them. I researched signs and symptoms online, and found Lexapro could cause them. I stopped taking Lexapro, and haven&#039;t experienced anymore. I would get one or two boils a week. They left ugly, permanent scars. Although, I&#039;ve found possible laser treatment may remove scars."	29-Jan-16
138509	Phentermine	"So far so good"	14-Jun-13
95694	Sertraline	"Did NOT want to take meds, but I am so glad I finally hit rock bottom and decided Zoloft was an option worth considering. Seriously, it has completely changed my life. As long as you have a reputable therapist/doctor giving you the meds, there should be no major issues. Had some problems with sleep at first, but I started taking melatonin at night and now it&#039;s all good."	26-Nov-14
72297	Tramadol	"I have a bleeding disorder so can&#039;t take NSAIDs. Unfortunately, I also have arthritis and shoulder pain. I was taking Tylenol #3 but didn&#039;t like the mental clouding side effect. Tramadol has worked great for me. I take 100 to 300 mg a day, tending toward the 100 side with 300 being for active weekends of running and biking (300 spread out in 3 doses, not all at once, obviously). This works really well. I&#039;m giving it an 8 because of the side effects (constipation and dry mouth).   I&#039;ve skipped a couple days with no problem and no overwhelming desire to take it (other than I hurt!)"	5-Dec-12
140578	Escitalopram	"I thought I&#039;d write a review as I spent months reading these forum&#039;s trying to decide if I should try escitroplam or not. It took me months to get the courage up to take it. I started at 2.5 and bumped up to 5.  I&#039;ve been on 5 for about 5 weeks now and wow what a difference.  Anxiety and panic attacks minimal and depression lifting. It&#039;s a very good drug. The least side effects of all I&#039;ve tried. Headaches,nausea but that&#039;s all. Very happy with this. I was extremely anxious about taking this after a bad experience with prozac but I&#039;m very pleased!"	29-Nov-16
119781	Ambien CR	"This is the only thing that I have tried that helps me sleep a full 8 hours. I love this medication. I have had no sleep walking and I have not done anything that I can&#039;t remember. The only side effects I have had are just feeling a little tired during the day and increased appetite. I would definitely recommend this medication to people with insomnia."	4-Apr-15
127856	Phentermine	"It definitely helps with cravings and weightloss, however if you have or do experience anxiety or depression already this pill is not going to help. I did lose about 5-6lbs the first couple weeks but I had to stop because it was making me a crazy person. I had the most horrible anxiety and I just felt mean and upset and sad and it really affected my emotions negatively. Just be careful!"	21-Dec-16
64532	Sertraline	"I could not bear the side effects I took half a pill once and was absolutely miserable for two days. I was so nauseous and tingly and I felt out of body. Maybe it would have worked if I stuck with it but it was not worth the side effect. Plus I have school to deal with. Dr is having me try lexapro. Btw I&#039;m 18."	4-Apr-16
127581	Phentermine	"Well, I am back for my one month results. Starting weight 6/20/17 - 324. Today&#039;s weight -297. That&#039;s right!!! 27 lbs!!!. I have started to watch my calorie intake, I walk 3 -4 days with my kids, then the other days I am at the gym doing cardio and toning. I stopped drinking pop. I am up to a gallon and half of water a day. I cut the carbs way back. I have tons of energy, I feel great and everyone tells me that they see so much of a change in my appearance.  I would recommend this to anyone, as long as you are looking for a lifestyle change. Not just a quick weight loss. (I have had friends who took it for fast weight loss, lost half the weight I have and gained it all back when they stopped)! This is meant to help with changing your life."	20-Jul-17
64187	Sertraline	"Tinnitus that is constant. Loud all the time and gets louder occasionally. It drives me crazy to the point of wanting to get off zoloft. I ask every Dr I see if anything can be done for tinnitus. Answer is always no. Is it this medication? Anyone with tinnitus will understand. I also have various problems urinating and sexual stuff. Thank you for giving me this forum."	7-Mar-17
127785	Phentermine	"Everyone talks about this amazing energy boost I have yet to experience that it does curb my appetite but it&#039;s also a lot of will power once some pounds came off I was more motivated in the gym I lost 30 pounds the first time around so was 230 stopped taking them and gained 21 pounds back but I also have pretty bad depression and was going though relationship issues and literally didn&#039;t step foot in the gym for months it works if you put in the work too"	28-Feb-17
140636	Escitalopram	"Wonder drug for me. I have been on and off 10 mg Lexapro for 5 years. Went through withdrawals while weaning myself off through the beginning of 2 pregnancies. Withdrawals feel like you are coming down with something and the world is a scary unknown new place. Brain zaps are weird too. But I went back on the medication after giving birth because I truly am the text book person with generalized anxiety disorder. It consumes every part of my life. I was just upped to 15 mg a week ago because the 10 was just not quite doing it for me anymore. Life has thrown some serious medical conditions our way. My son was diagnosed with cancer, as was my father, and my other son has down syndrome so my anxiety really spiked. The 15 mg has been wonderful."	5-Dec-16
95676	Sertraline	"Long story short anxiety took over my life overnight.  I was expediting looping thoughts, negative anxiety causing ones.  I am big on organic food/natural remedies etc.  I don&#039;t even like cold medicine so I went 3 months battling daily attacks.  Finally I couldn&#039;t take it anymore, Dr. prescribed clonazepam &amp; sertraline.  It did take the full 5 weeks for me, but I got control of my thoughts right away, with in days! Amazing! I lost weight on this, but my appetite has now returned.  I feel great! Totally normal, 8 weeks in &amp; forgot I ever had anxiety in the first place.  I feel 100% normal.  I wish I would have gone to the doctor sooner.  Hang in there, you can beat this!"	12-Dec-14
72138	Tramadol	"I have a 35 year old whiplash, so the pain is fairly chronic, and settles in my neck but moves into shoulders and mid back. My pain seems to be skeletal and muscular.   Tramadol is excellent at handling the pain.  I want it to always work, so I never take it until after the pain has started.  Sometimes I can go 2 days without taking a pill; other days, I have to take 2 pills in one day."	9-Mar-15
128049	Phentermine	"I started taking this drug prescribed by my doctor on 6/21/16. I had started a diet the previous week of only fruit and vegetables.  I dropped a good 8 pounds from that.  I started medication and it has helped my appetite control.  I took one full pill every day for a week.  I started walking a lot.  A good 2-3 miles a day.  I also kept with eating fruit in morning and low carb/protein during the rest of the day.  I have had to drop down to half a pill because of insomnia and have noticed constipation.  I am on weight watchers now and follow the plan.  I eat fruit and vegetables like crazy and I know it helps the weight loss.  I am down 13 pounds as of 7/8/16.  I am sure I will start to lose 1-2 pounds a week soon which is the healthy way."	8-Jul-16
64206	Sertraline	"I was on this drug after a traumatic experience that brought my anxiety up further than it ever had been. It helped take the edge off for the first few weeks during the summer, yet after a month into university when everything became stressful again, I stopped seeing results. I went up to 50mg after being on 25mg and I felt absolutely awful. I felt like I was trapped in a box but had to cary the weight of it everywhere. Functioning became harder and harder and I wasn&#039;t myself. I went back down and immidietly felt like I did after being on no medication. However at this point I started feeling depressed and suicidal, things that are not usual for me. Now I am beginning to try Fluvoxamine and hopefully it can fix what Zoloft caused."	6-Dec-16
72345	Tramadol	"I have a pinched nerve in my pelvis and for about a month I couldn&#039;t sit on the couch or a stool or even lay down in bed without severe pain in my lower back and even into my leg. My doctor put me on the tramadol and for the first time in over a month I was able to sleep with no pain. My only complaint is that it makes me feel incredibly itchy, I got great sleep, but I do remember rubbing and itching my face all night."	24-Jan-12
138688	Phentermine	"I started this drug two weeks ago in conjunction with Chantix to stop smoking. I have lost almost 20 pounds already. I have felt like a zombie and out of sorts, but don&#039;t know which medication is causing me to feel like this - maybe the two together. I have been smoke-free and will continue the phentermine until I have reached my goal weight."	19-Nov-11
96976	Ambien	"I have been taking Ambien for almost 1 yr now and find it to work just well.  I sleep for almost 6 hrs but it takes almost 1- 1.5 hrs to kick in for me. I take it when in bed because once it&#039;s in and the effect takes in I fall right asleep and don&#039;t remember what time I fell asleep, I wake up right when my alarm goes off or if I need to use the restroom.  I don&#039;t wake up groggy and feel pretty great about my day, everyone I believe would like to sleep in more but 4-6hrs is good for me.  I have horrible insomnia which keeps me up all night until about 6-7 am then maybe fall asleep fr being a zombie.  Ambien definitely helps &quot; me&quot;, but yes on a empty stomach is a must it else I can just say I wasted a pill.  Good luck with your experiences."	15-Oct-15
72250	Tramadol	"It worked better for me than Lortab."	3-Aug-12
128626	Phentermine	"I started taking Phentermine 37.5mg, 1Tab 2hrs after brkfst and half tab 6hrs before sleep. First day I experienced fast heart rate, dry mouth and insomnia after a couple days it went away.I go to the gym 3x a week, have to remind myself to eat at times. I started on March 30 2015 weighing at 207lbs my current weight today 06/18/15 is 179.6lbs I&#039;m really happy I don&#039;t think I ever weighed this much since JR high. Nothing has worked for me,but phentermine sure has, highly recommended."	18-Jun-15
141787	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve been dealing with anxiety for a very long time now, cried all the time, got upset over anything, always worried about something, had a horrible temper, and could never sleep or relax. I was always doing SOMETHING. I finally went to a doctor and told him everything that I was feeling and he prescribed me Lexapro 20mg.  I&#039;ve only been on it for a couple of days and its making me VERY sleepy, and I feel like I&#039;m not able to think. I&#039;m not to sure if I like this or if its just side effects, or maybe I need a lower dosage.  My mother is on the same medication and told me she felt the same way in the beginning.  Hopefully it goes away. All  your reviews have made me feel better about this medication.  Lets see how it works."	12-May-11
72444	Tramadol	"I started taking Tramadol 3 weeks after my spinal fusion. During the three weeks prior to starting Tramadol, I was taking narcotics around the clock. Withdrawal from the narcotics was severe and a difficult process for me. Once I was finished with that process, I started taking Tramadol 50-100 mg every 4-6 hours for back pain. With Tramadol I am able to stay awake during the day and manage my pain. These two factors allow me to work on my muscle strength and stamina. I am now 5 weeks post-op and do not require around the clock doses of Tramadol. I am not experiencing any withdrawal symptoms."	24-Apr-12
64985	Sertraline	"Been taking sertraline for a 3 1/2 weeks and I would have to say it was my best decision. It took me a while to say I was depressed and when I did my Dr. Started with 50 mg and I couldn&#039;t feel better. I would definitely recommend. Stop all bad thoughts, made me calmer, and able to deal with life outside of my bed."	1-Jan-15
96994	Ambien	"Take it on an empty stomach, or it won&#039;t work. I have terrible insomnia and have been on it long-term. It still works after 15 years. It had some initial side effects, but they went away after a few months. It works very well, but I gave it eight stars only because you have to take on an empty stomach. If I eat a late dinner, I can count on it not working. Otherwise, it&#039;s the only medication that has helped me sleep. I take 15-20 mg per night."	16-Jul-15
128299	Phentermine	"I have been on this for 4 months and have lost 18 lbs.  I think I have stalled because I am not sleeping due to taking it too late.  I also only had about 40 lbs to lose so I&#039;m thinking it may be slower compared to people who want to lose more.  My biggest concern is absolutely no one can tell that I have lost anything at all!! This makes me think that I&#039;ve lost all muscle and no fat.  How could 18 lbs not show?  I haven&#039;t worked out but am going to start to this upcoming week.  Has anyone else had this problem?"	4-Jan-16
64284	Sertraline	"When taking it after dinner meal I couldn&#039;t sleep through the night woke up every hour or two  - boo hoo. I started taking it in the morning after breakfast. Now I&#039;m sleeping 6 hours solid at night and helping me more in the day to be calmer."	4-Nov-16
71763	Tramadol	"I was initially prescribed tramadol for chronic pain from rheumatoid arthritis about 8 years ago, SPECIFICALLY because the doc said it was non narcotic. It worked for me and all was good until I forgot to call in a refill one day and I had withdrawal symptoms worse than I have ever experienced from any stronger narcotic. I have been on the drug for the past 8 years and now that they&#039;ve realized it&#039;s INCREDIBLY addictive and often abused, they&#039;ve made it a schedule 4. Now it&#039;s difficult for me to get my prescription if my doctor is out of town, or if I take one or two more than I&#039;m supposed to due to increased pain, and I run out a day or two early. I&#039;m a former opiate abuser and SO angry that I was misled and am on this roller coaster again."	17-Jan-17
64764	Sertraline	"I finally decided to get help with my anxiety and depression after many years of battling it. My doc prescribed me this and I was excited, to think I was finally going to get my life back. I&#039;m a 23 with 2 kids and a wonderful husband who now have to watch me cry in panic everyday. It has made it harder for me to work or be around people. Even after 3 weeks of being off the medication I still feel the effect of it. I feel worse, I&#039;m constantly in panic and scared of something that I have no control over. I am now constantly thinking about death in hopes that there is an afterlife. Something I have coped with years ago but its back. This medicine didn&#039;t do any good for me it did the exact opposite. Please take caution when taking this."	18-Aug-15
140783	Escitalopram	"I was prescribed this for anxiety and depression. In total, I took it for 6 weeks before coming off cold turkey on doctor&#039;s orders due to side-effects. The first 2 weeks I just had mild nausea and headaches. By the second week I started feeling a deep tiredness. I would sleep for about 16 hours a day. The need to sleep so much faded by end of week 3 but the deep tiredness never went away. I also had swelling and red lumps form under my left eye around this time. Week 4 brought insomnia and week 5 brought the rash on my legs. By the end of week 6, I had 360 degrees rash on legs that burned and bleed with lumps filled with puss. The pain was continuous and severe. Hence, off meds. Took two weeks for rash to fade to where it doesn&#039;t hurt."	23-Aug-16
128595	Phentermine	"I don&#039;t know what everyone is talking about. I have been taking this pill for two weeks and I haven&#039;t lost any weight whatsoever. I barely eat, so it did curb my appetite. I do a light workout because I have knee, back, and wrist problems. The only positive thing about this pill is that I no longer fall asleep on the couch. Two weeks ago I weighed 208 and today I still weigh 208."	30-May-15
96375	Sertraline	"It really helped me years ago when I took it for about 16 months. It was a nice break from my OCD which is pretty moderate. I had to take 200mg a day for it to be fully effective. I did gain a few pounds and takes longer to orgasm. But it all worked fine. The sad part is you do have a trade off when you take these things. The good news is you can stop taking it for a couple days and then orgasm is normal as it has a short half life. Then go right back to normal on dosage. It quit working for me after about 16 months and nothing else worked so decided to just be without it. I would try it if you need to."	25-Jan-10

214653	Escitalopram	"I suffer from persistent depression and generalized anxiety for as long as I can remember. I&#039;ve never been into the idea of taking medication, however, both symptoms eventually got worse with age, especially my anxiety. I decided enough was enough, and accepted the fact that medication was probably my best bet at living a happier life. My doctor prescribed Cipralex, also known as Escitalopram 10mg to help both symptoms. With high hopes of finally &quot;taking the plunge&quot; with medication, it did not result in my favour. Within ONLY AN HOUR of taking a single 10mg pill, I was overwhelming tired and could barely get out of bed. I also began getting sick for 45 mins...out of both ends. I felt so sick and sorry I ever took this medication."	12-Sep-17
96310	Sertraline	"I&#039;ve been on Zoloft for 3 weeks (100mg) and it&#039;s done wonders for me.  I was always sad, uninterested in anything, quick tempered, very negative...you get the picture.  Within a week that changed.  I&#039;m able to laugh, I want to do things again; best of all, my sex drive is returning!  My appetite has lessened, but I&#039;m not complaining.  In the first week, I was taking Zoloft by itself; now I&#039;m taking Seroquel XR in the evening in conjunction.  I&#039;m sleeping like a baby the night through (first time in years, really!).  My family and friends are as glad as I am that I&#039;m now on the right track."	21-Jul-10

214581	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve suffered from panic attacks/GAD for about 10yrs. I&#039;d manage them on my own but since moving cities they started back up again. I started having agoraphobia. I don&#039;t drink as my stepdad was an alcoholic and I became obsessed about checking ingredients in household/cosmetic products to ensure they didn&#039;t contain alcohol. If I found out I accidentally used something that had ethanol in it, I wouldn&#039;t leave the house for 2 days. I stopped driving and would cry everyday and have super anxiety. I went to my doctors and she prescribed me 5mg of Cipralex once a day and .5mg Klonopin. Less than 2 weeks on meds and I&#039;m driving again and fear of alcohol is almost gone. Amazing medication. Minimum side effects. Please try it. So happy its working."	28-Nov-17
139159	Phentermine	"I&#039;ve taken this pill on and off for a year. I too had dry mouth and restlessness along with aggressiveness but I ran across a solution to rid myself from all of the above. I take Calm which is magnesium and is all natural. It is good for all of the above symptoms including constipation. I use the powder form and it states you can use as much as you like to get the desired results."	2-Apr-09
96995	Ambien	"Be aware take this medication and immediately lay down !!!!!the first night I took this medication I was up apparently I don&#039;t remember !!!!so I was told, serving myself a shot ,eating, requested weird sexual favors,and was having conversations and answering myself,and had no memory of all these fun festivies the next day,lol,thanks ambien,lesson learned my boyfriend had a blast though!!!!!!!"	23-Jun-15
72328	Tramadol	"I have been using this medication to treat severe pain in my feet that radiates up my legs, associated with Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome. As one who is not a fan of narcotics and how they make me feel totally drugged and out of it, this medication is completely free of side effects and adverse reactions when I have taken it. I&#039;m even able to drive, work and accomplish my daily acts of living without any impairment or restriction due to this medication. Lastly, this medication has allowed me to continue to work on my feet (OR RN) while I use several modalities to treat my condition."	4-Jul-11
127902	Phentermine	"I am 33 years old and 5&#039;3 and weigh a whopping 300 pounds.  I went on phentermine because I wanted help with portion control and weight obviously, and started on 10/20/16. I had started taking Phentermine 15mg capsule once a day for a week, then I started the 37.5 mg capsule once a day till current.  When I started on the 15 mg capsule it was great! No major concerns, just dry mouth. Now I am on 37.5 and I have major dry mouth and tingling fingers and lips. I chose to still take it.  As of 10/27/16 I got weighed and I now weigh 291.  I lost 9 pounds in a week. Yay, its working.  I am only eating right but not exercising. I highly recommend it!  I only am giving it 9 stars because of the dry mouth and tingling fingers and lips.  Good luck"	2-Nov-16
96069	Sertraline	"Zoloft really does work. I take 50 mg right now and have been on it for about 5 weeks and my social anxiety and depression are almost completely gone. And now I feel happy.  My only side effect is occasionally my jaw trembles."	17-Jul-12
96276	Sertraline	"I have been taking sertraline for quite some time now (over a year) 100mg. Pros have been that I have been a lot calmer, not having panic attacks and less weepy and anxious. Unfortunately there have been some side effects which wont go away - I suffer from headaches a lot, extreme tiredness (am tired all the time - despite having 8  hrs sleep, etc.), I have no desire for sex and I have gained weight (though suspect the weight gain is more down to the tiredness and me attempting to get energy through food). On the whole though I&#039;m happy with it."	10-Mar-11
141332	Escitalopram	"This medication is fantastic.  I was suffering from some major anxiety for years and this has taken a huge burden off me.  There are still an occasional surge of anxiety but its an anomaly now where it used to be the norm for me. For those bad times I&#039;ll take Ativan and the combination between the two work awesome.  I only take about 4 Ativan a month,  the rest of the time Lexapro does the job. And I sleep SO much better."	12-Jan-15
96841	Ambien	"I&#039;ve been on it two years it has been wonderful for me the only downside is the tolerence I&#039;ve buliding up my doctor put me on Lunesta last night and I do not like it it did not work it makes me feel like garbage all day I want is to go back to my Ambien already!"	25-Apr-17
128127	Phentermine	"Been on generic adipex for 1 month. Start weight 183. Current weight 171. Drink lots of water on this. Dehydration can cause headaches ( get migraines already so this did not increase due to the medication). First day i was nauseous. first week was extreme dry mouth and complete lack of appetite. I had to remind myself to eat during the first week. At some point during the second week i was feeling a bit hungry but not the constant hunger i experienced before. As of the end of the first month the only persisting side effect if the dry mouth. I&#039;m also not sleeping very well! but I just take tylenol pm for that. overall i feel good. i&#039;m losing weight. im less hungry so i&#039;m selecting better food choices. (chocoholic lol) and no serious issues."	17-May-16
140842	Escitalopram	"Started Lexapro (Escitalopram) 10 mg taken at 8:00am  2 wks ago for anxiety and mild agoraphobia due to worry over having an anxiety attack-a tsunami of nervousness would overwhelm me and make me fearful and filled with unease. I was always worried about why this was happening to me out of nowhere. And I avoided going to places I once enjoyed. After day 12 a switch flipped.  I felt myself again, happy, easy going, not worried, not anticipating something bad was going to happen. What I cannot handle is the sleep disruption this drug has caused.  Waking at 3, 4 am and unable to get back to sleep.  Dr. prescribed  .50 mg Xanax, which is helping me through this side effect.  Hopefully it will subside when my body adjusts to the serotonin levels"	26-May-16
127973	Phentermine	"So i wanted to share this experience with everyone, Today i took my first 37.5 also i did my B12 inj last night. I will try to update weekly I&#039;M EXCITED!"	21-Oct-16
72054	Tramadol	"I experienced loss of appetite and had 3 falls due to this medication.  I also experienced being unusually cold and my hand/fingers would shake,  not the usual steady.  It all stopped after stopping tramadol.  I was prescribed the 50mg pill every 6 hours."	7-May-15
34113	Tramadol	"I take 100 mg &quot;as needed&quot; for chronic neck and shoulder pain after dual AFDC surgery which left me with some major nerve damage.  It doesn&#039;t totally relieve my pain, but it makes it tolerable. One dose makes me nauseous with or without food in my stomach. If I have a bad neck day and take 2 doses I will spend the night throwing up so I never take 2 doses any more."	27-Aug-09
140516	Escitalopram	"I&#039;m writing this for all the people that are about to give up hope.. it took me 3 years to find the right medication.. okay im not 100%yet but I&#039;m getting there. Please do not give up hope.  I&#039;ve tryed 5 diff types of antidepressents which all had bad side effects &amp; when that keeps happening it makes you want to give up. I was not going to try another type  for months because I thought they was useless.Then I tried Esclitalopram and it saved my life and my sons. It really did. I was in a dark horrible place.My issues was mainly anxiety which then turned into depression, the tablets lifted my mood within around 4 weeks  which then abled me to take steps in overcoming my anxiety, 6months later I&#039;m feeling so much better......You can get through this x"	29-Oct-16
138965	Phentermine	"I was 20 pounds overweight, not much for some but for someone who has never been overweight. It was traumatic.  My doctor prescribed phentermine - 1 per day - 30mg capsule - for four days per week only for 12 weeks.  I also changed my diet, counted calories, eliminated breads and sweets, and added a different exercise 4 times per week. I lost 15 pounds in 12 weeks. I probably would have lost more but I went on vacation for three weeks during this period. I would recommend this medicine to anyone who only needs to lose a small amount of weight."	29-Jul-09
71997	Tramadol	"Bad"	6-Oct-15
138606	Phentermine	"Taking this medication had extremely positive side effects that not only helped in losing 30 lbs but also gave me energy, decreased my symptoms associated with fibromylgia, and reduced my fixation on food. (It is my wonder pill)."	23-Jul-12
63840	Sertraline	"I was prescribed Zoloft for postpartum depression, anxiety and OCD of contamination. I took 10mg of Zoloft for two weeks only as it was ineffective for me. I experienced no side effects, which was the only upside. All medications work differently for different people. I experienced postpartum depression and anxiety only one month after my first and only son was born. As a first time mom I thought everything I was experiencing was typical, until I began having suicidal thoughts and resorted to self harm all taking a toll on my relationship with my son and husband. Waited until my son was 10 months old to finally get help. I felt severe anxiety still while taking Zoloft. Again this is only my experience with this medication."	8-Nov-17
128668	Phentermine	"I have been on phentermine for 3 weeks now and have not lost any weight at all. It has not decreased my appetite at all, although I do eat a healthy diet for the most part. Only effects I&#039;ve noticed is shakiness and a very dry mouth. I&#039;m very disappointed because nothing else has worked and this was my last hope at losing weight."	6-Apr-15
128746	Phentermine	"Started phentermine 37.5 on Feb 3, 2015 at 272lbs.  Currently at 258 lbs.  It was really exciting at first because I lost about 8lbs in one week.  Then I gained back 2lbs. (No reason, just did.)  Since then I have lost 0 to 2lbs a week.  I definitely feel that I am able to control my cravings and have some self control.  I love that!  What I did not love was the insomnia.  It was so awful that my Dr. presribed Ambien.  I am feeling much better with some solid sleep. I cannot express how much I hate using a drug to counteract a different drug.  I want to continue with the phen, I feel as if it is helping.  Hate that I have to pay a Dr. visit copay every month to get the prescription though.  Doubles the cost of the phen."	20-Mar-15
138429	Phentermine	"I started this medication 12 days ago.  The first week I lost 5 pounds, next weigh in is in 2 days.  The first day I had a mild headache but I now avoid that by avoiding caffeine.  I do have dry mouth a lot so I keep water nearby at all times.  I haven&#039;t had any kind of appetite so I have to force myself to eat. I highly recommend this medication!"	29-Jul-13
139023	Phentermine	"I started phentermine about 3 weeks ago and lost 10 lbs so far but may be more and definitely the inches are gone, but starting yesterday I started experiencing some chest pains and shortness of breath and its like a little pressure sitting on my chest/lungs. My doctor appointment is not until Tuesday but I will stop for now. I hate that because these pills do work, I have more energy, eating way less. I was just hungry all the time for no reason and it was hard for me to lose weight, exercising daily. My mom uses them and she hasn&#039;t had any side effects. She has lost 21 lbs so far. So my doctor may take me off, so if that%u2019s the case I will definitely have to buckle down and stay focused to lose the weight. Good Luck to everyone else."	20-May-09
97335	Ambien	"I am a poster child for Ambien and have been taking it for 2 months now and it has been a life saver.  Without it I would average at the most 3 hours sleep and that was after fighting sleep for about 6 hours."	20-Aug-08
96190	Sertraline	"I have been on Zoloft several times. The only side effect was the &quot;runs&quot; which is fine you can take anti-diarrhea medication.  I am also on Epilim, I was recently diagnosed with Bipolar which in itself is a good thing.  No antidepressant worked for me, I was always low.  And off them I was both hyper and low.  It was horrible, then the anxiety kicked in.  So that&#039;s why I am glad to be finally diagnosed as at least I can get help and proper treatment.  Zoloft is brilliant for anxiety, but it didn&#039;t stop the bad lows and I was so tired. But no side effects whatsoever, well only the runs - which you learn to live with."	11-Sep-11
128822	Phentermine	"I took this and it&#039;s the best thing I have ever tried. The first couple of days I went by the directions then I doubled the dose. And I lost 20 pounds in 2 weeks.  It did make me feel very jittery and my heart rate was going 90 to nothing but I was determined to lose weight.! And a little information DO NOT I repeat ( DO NOT ) take Fastin before you get in a tanning bed. Tan first then take it. It made me very very strange in a bad way.  I&#039;m no doctor but when I increased my dose I had the shaking and the increased heart rate. But It never harmed me."	24-Oct-14
95878	Sertraline	"For me, this medication did not work on a lower dose of 50 mg, 100 mg, or even 150 mg. My depression got better once I was increased to 200 mg, which is the therapeutic limit, but this may be because my depression was incredibly severe -extremely suicidal, and not functioning at all.     However, after taking this medication for a little over a year, I have come to the realization that it no longer is working for me, and I am experiencing what my psychiatrist calls a &quot;poop out,&quot; which is apparently something most SSRIs can do. I would recommend Zoloft (Sertraline) to anyone who has depression. It has honestly been the best medication for me, but for now, I need to try something new."	29-May-14
128290	Phentermine	"I haven&#039;t wrote a review on here in a while but really want others to share because it helps me keep going. So I began in May 2015 at 275 my highest weight ever, I am now at 220 according to my scale at home which usually is a little over my docs scale. I have taken a total of 5 month doses in these 8 months because I don&#039;t want to purely depend on the pills. But they are amazing I get crazy cravings and loose motivation easily these help so much. I would like to loose another 40lbs to help me keep it off I plan on using b-12 shots that I also love."	11-Jan-16
138555	Phentermine	"Started my first dose Thursday 4/25 weighing 222lbs. Today 4/30 I am at 209.5. That&#039;s a 12.5 lb loss in 6 days! Can&#039;t wait to see where I&#039;m at on day 30! Only side effect I had was trouble sleeping. Started taking Unisom and problem solved. I never got dry mouth because I drink close to a gallon of water a day. So far so good so I&#039;m going to keep on keeping on!"	30-Apr-13
142139	Escitalopram	"No side effects...and no more panic attacks. Yay."	9-Jul-08
127422	Phentermine	"I have always been up and down with my weight, but never to the point where you look at yourself in the mirror and don&#039;t know who you are looking at any more. Well!!! I have reached that point where I said &quot;ENOUGH IS ENOUGH&quot; I tried working out and eating well, a personal trainer, fasting, pills, diets and a lot more. You name it, I tried it! Well 6 weeks ago I decided to give Adipex-P along with B12 &amp; Methionine Inositol Choline (MIC) Injections injections a try. Guess what? I have lost 26 pounds. I cant explain how amazing this feels... IT WORKS! The 1st week alone I lost 8 pounds and I didn&#039;t even work out. The only side effect I got is Dry mouth which is good b/c it keep you drinking water. Once you see it works you will keep going b/c you feel motivated. Good Luck :) &amp; GBU"	6-Nov-17
95869	Sertraline	"20 year old male.  After failing 2 of my college classes in one semester, decided it was time to do something about my increasing depression.  Doctor started me on Zoloft.  Took about 4 weeks to start to notice the effects.  Occasional shakes.  Memory loss was frequent.  Immediately noticed a decrease in sex drive and wasn&#039;t a problem until I started dating again and couldn&#039;t get it up the first time I got with my current girlfriend.  Luckily she is understanding.  My doctor is switching me to Wellbutrin.  If it wasn&#039;t for the decreased sex drive I probably would have stayed on it."	20-Jun-14

I am happy to share 90% My symptoms resolved, i felt like my eye sight has increased,everything look beautiful and colorful ,i got unknown source of happiness, even my friends say i am new man.  (I am not recomending anyone to take escitalopram. Always consult a registerd practitioner)"	14-Sep-15
128879	Phentermine	"I started Fastin 30mg from my doctor on May 19 2014. You need to change your lifestyle not just pop a pill and be done with it. Because if you don&#039;t change, the weight will return. I started at 285lbs in one month I lost 25lbs and feel great. I changed myself with habit changes and exercise. I told myself that when this weight is gone it&#039;s staying gone, so I change my lifestyle and you can do the same."	26-Jun-14
214580	Escitalopram	"I randomly started having horrible anxiety making me feel sick and wanting to avoid all social situations. Dr put me on Lexapro 10mg and it&rsquo;s been a life saver. I was worried at first with bad reviews, but I shouldn&rsquo;t have been. Only side effect was dry mouth the first two days. Took about 3 weeks to work, but suddenly one day I realized I had no anxiety. It&rsquo;s been a blessing."	29-Nov-17
64894	Sertraline	"Sertraline does help Social Anxiety and Depression associated with this. I have been on it for nine months and if I said it has not provided me any benefit, I&#039;d be lying. It allows you to think more rationally, therefore making CBT more effective and easier. Also, it is good for Depression. It helped me to be more positive and covered up my depressive thoughts, although they do come up every now and then. I take Zoloft primarily for SA and I feel I need something a little more anxiolytic, obviously Zoloft IS anxiolytic as it is an antidepressant, however I do feel slightly jittery and twitchy whilst on it (I am at a maximum 200mg). I am moving on soon, to Paxil or Lexapro, preferably Paxil. I&#039;d recommend Zoloft for someone with a mix though"	15-May-15
138900	Phentermine	"During my pregnancy I put on about 50 lbs! Now I&#039;m trying to get it off. Just started phentermine up again a few days ago at 194 lbs. I work out at the gym 2-3 days a week doing cardio and weights. I also walk about 30 minutes most weekdays during my lunch break. I already feel my clothes fitting looser. I get very jittery, have dry mouth and insomnia. I will stick to it because I have had excellent results with it in the past. In 2007 I lost over 50 lbs in about 6 months. My target range is 140-150 this time. So I am wishing all of us luck. Please remember that once you get off the medication it is very easy to put the weight back on unless you really work at it."	11-May-10
64572	Sertraline	"I was switched over to this medication after taking celexa for 6 years and a trial run of cymbyax. I know you have to wait for medications to work, so I stuck it out.  2 months later and nothing had changed. My anxiety gets so bad that I actually crash (sleep, fatigue). It&#039;s like my mind goes 100 mph and I go just as fast. My anger outburst got worse as my anxiety kicked into high gear after taking this. Just because it didn&#039;t work for me doesn&#039;t mean it won&#039;t work for the next person! It works great for my sister in law, but for me it just made things worse."	3-Feb-16
127604	Phentermine	"I have tried everything I could to lose weight from pills, to shakes, to teas, to detoxing, to even a lap band, and NONE of it worked. I had hit my all-time high of 230. I went to my fertility doctor and she said I was in bad health to try to have a baby. My cholesterol was high, my blood pressure was high, and to make it worse, I was pre-diabetic. I&#039;ve been on adipex now for a month and a half. I&#039;ve lost 35 lbs, barely exercise, but I&#039;m so full of energy that I&#039;ve completely redone my house, cleaned the garage, and refurbished lots of furniture pieces. I LOVE IT!!! I&#039;ve not had his much energy since I was in my 20s! I do have about 20 more lbs to go and it will be off in no time."	19-May-17
139136	Phentermine	"I have taken Phentermine for 2 weeks and have lost 6 lbs. The one thing I notice the most is the wave of heat that starts at my neck and engulfs my face."	30-Oct-08
127978	Phentermine	"First week 7 lbs lost, 2nd week 8 lbs lost, week 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, nothing. The extra energy is great, the best side effect is NO MORE BLADDER LEAKAGE ! This is not a mentioned side effect, but I&#039;ll continue this little pill forever if I can for that one reason! The chronic constipation is horrible, I have to take ducolax a lot."	19-Oct-16
140604	Escitalopram	"Went on these 8 weeks ago. 4 weeks on 10mg then 4 weeks on 20mg.  They&#039;ve just started to work properly and I feel much more positive.  To get the most benefit I&#039;ve had to stop drinking and improve my diet.  I was pretty depressed and having anxious thoughts for two years before taking these.  I&#039;ve taken Elavil, Remeron and Lustral before but not really had good results.  Felt odd at first but side effects have reduced.  Still having strange feeling yawns, slightly delayed and weaker orgasm (was much worse to begin with), along with a little insomnia.  I&#039;m putting up with these.  I think Lexapro is &quot;cleaner&quot; than the other SSRIs and more precise.  I plan to take these for a year and then take a break, but will need them again in the future."	4-Feb-17

140862	Escitalopram	"I&#039;m a 26 year old woman. After suffering from depression and anxiety for most of my life, I finally decided to seek help from my doctor and he recommended that I try Escitalopram for a month to see if it helps. I didn&#039;t ever think I would feel &quot;normal&quot; but this medication has literally saved my life. I had mild side effects when I first started taking it (gas, nausea, lack of appetite, excessive yawning, and my tongue went a little numb), but they have subsided now at two weeks and I&#039;ll I&#039;m left with is feeling balanced! I feel wonderful. I do take it at night because I found it worked better for me and insomnia that I&#039;ve suffered from for years has gone away. I have gotten my life back."	6-Apr-16
92720	Allergy DN PE	"It took years to find the right combination of medications for me. Without it, I am a leaky faucet, with morning nausea and vomiting, constant runny nose, sore throat. They keep recalling this. I could handle it for a few weeks but this is year round!"	6-May-10
127852	Phentermine	"I am a large portion eater.  I eat well but I eat too much and too many carbs.      I started Phentermine 37.5 daily on 11/22/16. I have gone from 218 to 207.  I lost 6 pounds the first week.  I drank a lot of water the first week and I haven&#039;t since, so I think that is key to the med working.  I was a little Jittery a few times but it passes.  Some dry mouth occasionally.  Other than that I am very pleased.  Hoping to continue losing and hit my goal of 160.  I am concerned as my Doctor said 3 months on then 3 months off.  Time will tell I guess."	27-Dec-16
141481	Escitalopram	"I was on Lexapro for a year and decided to come off because of weight gain. The weight gain was mostly the result of not really caring about working out and the food I was eating. I&#039;m sure that could be controlled with a little more willpower on my part.  Other than that this medicine saved my life. I have had several episodes of depression with significant anxiety. I tried other SSRIs and experienced terrible side effects, mainly increased anxiety and severe insomnia. While Lexapro did cause some increased anxiety for the first few days it was manageable and after about 7 weeks I felt great and back in control of my life. I have been off of it for 3 months and my symptoms are returning. So I am going back on it and plan to stay on it."	6-Nov-13
64806	Sertraline	"I&#039;m 14 years old with OCD. I tried Prozac and it just made me make decisions that weren&#039;t like me. Ive been on Zoloft for awhile and it&#039;s really helping. I haven&#039;t obsessed at ALL. I just don&#039;t overthink and I live a great life."	27-Jul-15
140714	Escitalopram	"I&#039;ve been taking Lexapro (escitaploprgram) since February. First, I&#039;d like to mention that you can NOT take this drug for a week or less and expect to magically feel better; I felt really sick the first two weeks on this drug. But you HAVE to give the drug time. For me, I didn&#039;t really start noticing the drugs positive effects for about two months. I took Zoloft before this and felt like it made me too tired and absent-minded. Luckily, Lexapro doesn&#039;t seem to have this effect (although I do drink caffeinated drinks). I like Lexapro not only because my anxiety and depression is completely gone, but I feel like I can finally handle everything in my life now (I&#039;m a working full-time college student). I highly recommend this drug."	8-Oct-16
